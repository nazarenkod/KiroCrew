    """Stage one SQLite database without ever reopening its live name.

    The copy comes through :func:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs.copy_file_pinned`, so the same
    descriptor-level screens every other core file gets apply here too -- crucially the
    hardlink refusal, which is the only way to notice that ``memory.db`` has been aliased
    onto a credential-bearing database elsewhere. A path check cannot see that: an alias
    shares its target's inode.

    SQLite then runs against the raw copy inside the private staging directory, not
    against anything in the data home. That is what closes the reopen window rather than
    merely detecting it: an attacker swapping the live name during this function affects
    nothing, because nothing reads that name after the descriptor copy.

    **A live log means the database is OMITTED, not copied.** In WAL mode a committed
    transaction lives in ``<db>-wal`` until a checkpoint folds it back, and two files
    cannot be copied atomically without locking out the writer. Four review rounds were
    spent trying to make a two-file copy safe and none of them was: copying the main file
    alone drops committed rows, and copying both in either order can archive a database
    that restores BACKWARDS -- SQLite validates a log against its own checksums, not
    against the main file's generation, so a log copied before a commit was checkpointed
    replays its older page images over the newer main file and erases that commit.

    (I asserted the opposite in an earlier round -- that a stale log's salt would not match
    and SQLite would ignore it. That was wrong, and the test I wrote to defend it passed
    only because its fixture never produced the losing interleaving.)

    So the contract is now a refusal instead of a reconciliation: checkpoint first, and if a
    non-empty log survives that, omit the database and record why. An absent database with
    a recorded reason is recoverable information; one that silently restores to an older
    state is not. The checkpoint is attempted with a busy timeout precisely so the common
