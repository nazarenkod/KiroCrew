"""Recipient authorization on the PROACTIVE send path, per transport.

``authorize`` gates a turn a user drove. Nothing gated the messages nobody asked
for -- a cron result, a compaction notice, a subagent completion -- because those
resolve their destination from a **persisted** ``ChannelLink``, and a link records
a conversation but not the principal that authorized it. Remove a recipient from a
channel's allow-list, restart, and every proactive leg still resolved that link and
still sent to them: the roster had changed and nothing re-read it.

Two halves, mirroring ``test_messaging_import_purity``:

* an **enumerate-once gate** requiring every shipped transport to override
  ``may_send_to`` and make its own decision explicit, so a channel cannot inherit
  the permissive ABC default silently, and a NEW channel cannot skip the question;
* **behavioral** tests per transport that can answer authoritatively, plus the
  shared chokepoint that consults them.

The gate is AST-based on purpose: it needs to see every channel package without
importing eight clients' optional dependencies, and a transport that fails to
import is exactly the one whose gap would go unnoticed.
