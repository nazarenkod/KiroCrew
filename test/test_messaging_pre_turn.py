"""The shared pre-turn sequence, and the ratchet that keeps channels on it.

Three findings on the Feishu channel review traced to one cause: the shared
state object (``ConversationState``) existed, but every dispatcher had to
REMEMBER to drive it in the right order, and nothing enforced that. These tests
pin the order itself, plus a source-level ratchet so a channel added later
cannot quietly hand-roll the sequence again and re-open the same hole.
