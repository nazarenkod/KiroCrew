"""Every variable-resolution site must run off the event loop.

This anchor was raised four rounds running, each time naming a different site, because
the fix was applied one site at a time. This enumerates the class instead: the four
helpers that resolve variables all do a ``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` (a synchronous read,
parse and validate of config.json) plus a variables-store read, and every dispatch path
reaching them is on the gateway event loop.

Asserted on the CALL SITES rather than by timing, because the property is structural:
the helper is handed to an offloader instead of being invoked inline.
