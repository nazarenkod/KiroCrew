# Messaging Transport Module

## Overview

`kiro_crew.messaging` is the channel-neutral transport abstraction used by the shipped Slack, Discord, Telegram, Webex, WeCom, Microsoft Teams, Weixin, and iMessage integrations; its conservative contract also leaves room for future channels such as WhatsApp. It avoids re-implementing streaming, tool approval, session identity, or rendering for each integration. It holds the channel-neutral core of the Slack turn loop (`slack/handler.py::handle_message`) so a new channel implements only two small interfaces (a `MessagingTransport` + a `Renderer`) and inherits everything else.

**Dependency direction is one-way:** `slack` / `dashboard` → `messaging`, never the reverse. The `kiro_crew.messaging` package imports nothing from `kiro_crew.slack` or `kiro_crew.dashboard`; its only first-party dependencies are the shared lower-level helpers — `acp.types` event constants, the `security` redactors (`redact_credentials` / `redact_exfiltration_urls`), and `sel` for audit.

Slack's transport path is gated behind the `messaging.use_transport` config flag (default `true` in Kiro Crew, so the abstraction is the canonical path); when off, Slack's native `handle_message` path runs instead.

## Architecture — the three layers

```
 inbound event   Layer 1: MessagingTransport (per channel)
  ─────────────▶   receive() → drop bots → normalize → authorize()
                   → InboundMessage → dispatch callback
                            │
 provider stream  Layer 2: TurnDriver (channel-neutral)
  ─────────────▶   redact → approval ladder → OutputEvent
                   → Renderer.dispatch()
                            │
 channel API      Layer 2b: Renderer (per channel)
  ◀────────────    on_text_chunk / on_thinking / on_tool_call /
                   on_prompt_choice / on_compaction / on_done

 Layer 3 (cross-cutting): ChannelLink + session-key namespacing
   f"{channel_type}:{conversation_id}" ⇄ legacy bare Slack thread_ts
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `messaging/__init__.py` | Package facade re-exporting the public contracts, approval-mode constants, and Layer-3 helpers |
| `messaging/transport.py` | **Layer 1** — `MessagingTransport` ABC + the `TransportCapabilities`, `InboundMessage`, and `ConfiguredChannelTarget` value objects (stdlib-only) |
| `messaging/driver.py` | **Layer 2** — `TurnDriver` (channel-neutral turn loop), approval-mode constants, `_redact` helper |
| `messaging/renderer.py` | **Layer 2b** — `Renderer` ABC, `OutputEvent`, output-kind constants + `OUTPUT_KINDS`, `chunk_text` helper, `apply_options_cap`/`cap_choices`/`format_overflow` (`max_buttons` enforcement) |
| `messaging/display_safety.py` | `strip_ansi` / `canonicalize_display` / `redact_for_display` — credential redaction against the form a platform RENDERS, not the bytes sent. Hoisted out of `slack/format.py` when the shared overflow sink began writing choice text into the parsed body on every widget channel |
| `messaging/split.py` | `split_markdown_safe` — the shared fence-safe markdown splitter (stdlib-only, pure). Prefix-stable so streaming callers can send sealed chunks and keep only the last as a live buffer. Also exports `iter_fence_spans`, the same fence machine viewed as character spans over a whole message |
| `messaging/outbound_files.py` | `extract_local_refs` (+ `extract_local_refs_off_loop`) — pulls local markdown image references out of an outbound reply into `OutboundFile` payloads carrying the validated bytes, with `Rejection` reasons for everything refused. Also `iter_local_refs` / `hide_local_refs`, the text-only scan a streaming channel uses to keep the markup off live frames. Channel-neutral; the upload stays per-transport |
| `messaging/raster.py` | `sniff_raster_mime` — what counts as a raster, decided by leading bytes. Dependency-free (no `kiro_crew` imports) so both the inbound sniff and the outbound extractor can share it |
| `messaging/tables.py` | `render_tables` + the `off`/`cards`/`grid`/`native`/`auto` policy contract and `display_width` — outbound Markdown-table rendering for a target that shows a pipe table as literal pipes (stdlib-only, pure) |
| `messaging/link.py` | **Layer 3** — session-key namespacing (`session_key`/`canonical_key`/`legacy_key`/`is_legacy_slack_key`) + `ChannelLink` + DM-scope key derivation / `should_rotate_generation`, plus the in-channel `/link` ⇄ `/unlink` pair (`rebind_conversation_location` / `release_conversation_location`) |
| `messaging/commands.py` | The channel-neutral half of the shared chat commands — `/stop`'s cancel + lock ordering (`stop_running_turn`), `/yolo`'s grant ladder (`run_yolo_command`), and the dashboard-link TTL vocabulary (`parse_dashboard_ttl` / `format_ttl`). Returns reply TEXT, never sends; takes no address of any kind |
| `messaging/conversation.py` | `ConversationState` — per-conversation rotating *generation* bookkeeping (advanced by `/new` and idle/daily reset), seeded from the persisted session map |
| `messaging/session_resume.py` | **Layer 3** — the channel-neutral half of dashboard-session resume: which sessions are offerable (`resolve_session_choices`, reusing the dashboard's own ranker), the nonce/TTL/owner-scoped `PickerRegistry`, and `SessionBinder` — the conflict rules plus the inbound routing + settlement state machine. Shared by Discord and Teams; a channel supplies only a `ResumeSurface` (widget + wording) and a `ResumeCopy` |
| `messaging/resume_expectation.py` | The durable conversation-keyed shadow of those bindings, ONE file per channel (`store_filename`), because a Discord channel id and a Teams conversation id are unrelated address spaces |
| `teams/service_urls.py` | `ServiceUrlStore` — durable `conversation_id -> serviceUrl` (plus the authorized identity owning each conversation), because the Bot Framework offers no lookup and a lost reference leaves every proactive path with nowhere to send. `forget` drops a route the Connector permanently refuses |
| `teams/cards.py` | Adaptive Card construction + `parse_submit` — the strict, total validation of an untrusted card payload. Mints no nonce of its own: every clickable widget's token comes from `messaging.renderer.new_approval_nonce` |
| `teams/approvals.py` | `TeamsApprovalDecider` — awaits one Approve / Approve+auto-approve / Deny click, deny-by-default on every non-answer. Holds NO grant: the button's press is recorded and the dispatcher arms the shared process-wide grant through `messaging.commands.run_yolo_command` |
| `teams/session_resume.py` | Teams' half: the Adaptive Card picker, its display redaction, and the owner rule — which is STRICTER than Discord's for a reason (see the Teams section) |
| `teams/attachments.py` | Teams' file halves — the two inbound shapes with OPPOSITE fetch auth, the inline-image outbound policy, and `quoted_reply_text` (a 1:1 quote-reply's own words, which `activity.text` does not carry cleanly) |
| `slack/transport.py` | Slack reference `MessagingTransport` (`SlackTransport`) over `SlackClientOps` |
| `slack/renderer.py` | Slack reference `Renderer` (`SlackRenderer`) + `SlackApprovalDecider` + `build_approval_blocks` |
| `slack/transport_dispatch.py` | `handle_message_transport()` — full new-path dispatch wiring the three layers together |

## Layer 1 — `MessagingTransport` (`transport.py`)

Channel-neutral inbound/outbound contract. A new channel = implement this interface + an inbound adapter, with zero change to the shared turn-handling core.

- **Class attributes**: `channel_type: str` (e.g. `"slack"`) and a `capabilities: TransportCapabilities`.
- **Tier-1 core (abstract)**: `send_message(conversation_id, content, thread_id=None) -> str` (returns a platform message id), `resolve_conversation(user_id) -> str` (the `open_dm` equivalent), `fetch_history(conversation_id, thread_id=None) -> list[InboundMessage]`.
- **Lifecycle (default no-op, override as needed)**: `connect()` (lazy-import client libs HERE), `maintain()` (poll/heartbeat), `disconnect()`.
- **Inbound adapter (abstract)**: `receive(raw_envelope)` (ack → filter → authorize → normalize → dispatch) and `authorize(msg) -> bool`. `authorize` MUST be **deny-by-default** — an unconfigured transport authorizes nobody.

### `TransportCapabilities`

Declares what a channel can do. Defaults are deliberately conservative (the WhatsApp-like floor) so a transport that forgets to declare a capability degrades safely rather than over-promising.

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `streaming` | `False` | feature flag |
| `edit` | `False` | feature flag |
| `reactions` | `False` | feature flag |
| `files_inbound` | `False` | feature flag — the two directions land per channel and in different changes, so ONE `files` boolean was undecidable and got the wrong answer for one of them |
| `files_outbound` | `False` | ENFORCED — gates whether a renderer extracts and uploads a local image reference. Declaring `False` keeps printing the path, which is the honest degradation |
| `rich_blocks` | `False` | feature flag |
| `threads` | `False` | feature flag |
| `table_mode` | `off` | outbound table presentation: `off` / `cards` / `grid` / `native` / `auto`; read only by renderers that use `render_tables_for_target` |
| `native_tables` | `False` | the target renders a GFM pipe table AS a table; checked before `native` may pass through |
| `supports_session_resume` | `False` | ENFORCED — gates whether a dashboard connect marks the binding as an inbound resume target (`direction: both`). Only a transport whose inbound path resolves the mirror binding may declare it |
| `max_message_chars` | `4096` | quantitative — Slack 3900, Telegram 4096, Discord 2000, Teams 16000, WhatsApp 4096. A CHARACTER count: a byte-capped platform must declare a value safe at its worst-case bytes-per-char (Webex and Teams are pinned in `test_capability_ledger.py`) |
| `max_buttons` | `3` | TOTAL interactive choices per prompt (WhatsApp reply buttons = 3); enforced via `apply_options_cap` — overflow degrades to a numbered text list |
| `supports_proactive_send` | `True` | send-policy (WhatsApp: `False` outside its 24h window) |

`to_dict()` serializes all fields. The integer *parameters* (not booleans) capture where channels differ quantitatively so the `Renderer` can chunk / degrade rather than assume a single shape.

### `InboundMessage`

Normalized, channel-agnostic inbound message: `channel_type`, `user_id`, `conversation_id`, `text`, `thread_id=None`, `attachments=[]`, `is_mention=False`; `to_dict()` for serialization.

## Layer 2 — `TurnDriver` (`driver.py`)

Consumes a provider's `AcpEvent` stream and emits abstract `OutputEvent`s to a per-transport `Renderer`. It owns the channel-neutral turn concerns — credential/exfiltration redaction and the tool-approval decision — so every channel inherits them once.

**Redaction and protocol framing** — before text reaches a renderer, `TurnDriver` first classifies a reserved summary-bearing compaction notice at the start of the turn, then incrementally parses kiro-cli's inline `[STEERING steer-<id>: …]` frame across arbitrary chunk boundaries. Compaction summary bodies become the terse `✅ Context compacted.` receipt. Steering frames never become text: they emit one structured `STEER_CONSUMED` event at the exact boundary (paired with kiro-cli's typed lifecycle event regardless of arrival order). The user-facing `[OPTIONS: …]` trailer is deliberately not part of this filter and passes through unchanged for renderer-native buttons. After framing, `_redact()` runs `redact_exfiltration_urls()` then `redact_credentials()` (both from `security.py`) over every text chunk, thinking chunk, tool title/purpose, and each string field of prompt-choice options before it reaches a renderer.

The dashboard does **not** flow through `TurnDriver`; it remains unchanged as the authoritative transcript surface. Direct channel paths that bypass the driver are sanitized at source: Discord's explicit five-message resume replay strips legacy steering frames and summary-bearing compaction notices, shortens each entry to the shared splitter's first (sealed) chunk so a replayed code block cannot arrive with its fence cut in half, and puts the role icon on its own line so the body's first line still starts where the fence grammar needs it; direct compact commands publish only terse receipts. Stored transcripts remain intact for audit.

**Session-directive consumption** — an optional `directive_consumer` callback (`(kind, args) -> awaitable`) makes the driver the channel-side consumer of the stateless session-directive protocol (`session_directive.py`): the trusted `_meta.kiro` identity is resolved by the shared forgery-gate predicate (`session_directive.directive_tool_for(mcp_server_name, tool_name)`, the same single spelling the dashboard consumer uses) and recorded at `EVENT_TOOL_CALL`, and the matching `EVENT_TOOL_RESULT`'s marker is decoded and handed to the consumer — single-consume across result frames, forged markers under any other tool ignored, `encode()` refusals logged, a lost marker on the final frame logged at WARNING. A tool call announced as a NATIVE sub-agent's (`EVENT_SUBAGENT_ACTIVITY` with a `tool_call_id`) is refused with a SEL `denied` audit rather than applied — a child session must never arm/mutate its parent, mirroring the dashboard consumer's isolation. Dispatchers inject `messaging.dispatch.build_directive_consumer(session_key=…, sessions=…, dispatcher=…)`, which funnels into the same `apply_session_directive` core the dashboard consumer uses with `slot=None` (so card-producing dashboard-only directives stay refused for channel turns). Channel `set_project` writes the durable per-conversation project/CWD override; because its tool result arrives while the current provider still owns the turn semaphore, the provider is not killed in place. The next claimant acquires the old semaphore, replaces that provider, and cold-starts in the new CWD before sending its prompt. The monitor trio takes effect where the session is nudge-able (`slack:`/`discord:`); on the other six transports (Telegram, iMessage, Teams, Webex, WeCom, Weixin) the applier answers "not supported from this session type" — logged and SEL-audited instead of the old silent drop, but no loop is armed there until `autonudge.binding_key_for` admits those keys. Without a consumer, directive markers are inert exactly as before.

**`run(message) -> str`** — calls `renderer.on_turn_start()`, then translates each provider event into a dispatched `OutputEvent` and returns the accumulated (redacted) assistant text:

| Provider event | Emitted `OutputEvent` |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| `EVENT_TEXT_CHUNK` | `TEXT_CHUNK` (protocol-framed, redacted, accumulated); inline steering frames become `STEER_CONSUMED`, compaction summary notices become a terse receipt |
| `EVENT_THINKING_CHUNK` | `THINKING` |
| `EVENT_STEER_CONSUMED` | paired with the inline frame so exactly one `STEER_CONSUMED` boundary reaches the renderer |
| `EVENT_TOOL_CALL` | `TOOL_CALL` (uniform — each call completes the prior task + starts a new one); records the directive-tool identity when a `directive_consumer` is injected |
| `EVENT_TOOL_RESULT` | nothing rendered; decodes + applies a session-directive marker via the injected `directive_consumer` (inert without one) |
| `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST` | `PROMPT_CHOICE` (interactive w/ decider only) then approve/reject |
| `EVENT_COMPACTION_STATUS` | `COMPACTION` |
| `EVENT_COMPLETE` | `DONE` |

### Approval ladder

Four modes (constants, mirroring the native Slack + dashboard ladder):

| Constant | Value | Behavior in `_approve()` |
|----------|-------|--------------------------|
| `APPROVAL_AUTO` | `"auto"` | approve |
| `APPROVAL_TRUST` | `"trust"` | approve |
| `APPROVAL_TRUST_READS` | `"trust-reads"` | approve iff `event.tool_kind == "read"` |
| `APPROVAL_INTERACTIVE` | `"interactive"` | **deny-by-default** unless the injected `decider` approves |

Two injected predicates take precedence over the ladder (both checked per permission request, and both auto-approve immediately — no buttons, no decider wait):

- `auto_approve_tool: (tool_title) -> bool` — hook-driven auto-approve (e.g. `spawn_run` via the context builder's `auto_approve_subagent_spawn` hook). Reason logged as `hook_auto_approve`.
- `auto_approve_session: () -> bool` — honors the auto-approve grant without the driver importing any channel module. Reason logged as `session_trust`. **Every shipped channel passes it**, and for a decider-less one it is the ONLY rung. All of Webex, WeCom, iLink (weixin), iMessage, Telegram, Discord and Teams pass the same `() -> safety_override().is_active()` — the ONE process-global grant the dashboard toggle drives. Slack is the outlier, passing a narrower channel-local `is_slack_session_trusted`. **A new channel should follow the seven, not Slack.** A channel-local trusted set is a SECOND grant: its own lifetime, its own audit trail, and its own way to disagree with the dashboard about whether auto-approve is on — and "is YOLO on?" has to have one answer. Omitting the keyword entirely is not a neutral default either: it makes arming YOLO from the dashboard INERT on that channel, so an unattended run still stops on every tool prompt with nobody there to answer, which is how Discord shipped until it was enrolled.

**Teams has a decider AND the shared predicate, and that combination is the
pattern.** It renders Adaptive Card approvals, so it passes a real `decider`; it
also passes the same `() -> safety_override().is_active()` the buttonless channels
do, because it keeps NO grant of its own. Its `/yolo` goes through the shared
`run_yolo_command`, and its card's middle button arms that identical grant through
the identical helper — so the command and the button cannot diverge, and neither can
disagree with the dashboard. The button is therefore labelled "Approve +
auto-approve" rather than "Trust session": the blast radius is every surface until
the grant expires, and a control has to say what it does. The label alone is not
enough, so the card body also carries `messaging.commands.YOLO_SCOPE_NOTE` — the one
sentence naming what the grant covers, shared with the reply `/yolo on` returns so a
pre-press affordance and the confirmation cannot describe different scopes.
"Auto-approve" on a button inside one chat otherwise reads as scoped to that chat.
Expiry, renewal, the duration and the SEL row all belong to the shared helper, which
is the point — a channel-local store would have had to reimplement every one of them.

`decider: ApprovalDecider` (`Callable[[Any], Awaitable[bool]]`) supplies the interactive click; when omitted, interactive mode denies by default (so buttons are only rendered when a decider exists — otherwise the user would get dead controls). Every permission decision emits an `sel().log_api_access` event (`caller="turn_driver"`, `operation="tool_permission"`, `source="messaging"`, `outcome` one of `auto_approved` / `approved` / `denied`).

## Layer 2b — `Renderer` + `OutputEvent` (`renderer.py`)

### `OutputEvent`

Channel-neutral output event with a `kind` plus per-kind payload fields (`text`, `tool_call_id`, `title`, `tool_kind`, `tool_purpose`, `options`, `request_id`, `context_usage_pct`, `stop_reason`); `to_dict()` serializes them. Kinds: `TEXT_CHUNK`, `THINKING`, `TOOL_CALL`, `PROMPT_CHOICE`, `COMPACTION`, `DONE` — the full set is `OUTPUT_KINDS` (a `frozenset`). `prompt_choice` is a **first-class** event, not generic "permission text": each renderer maps it to its native interactive widget.

### `Renderer` ABC

Constructed with a `TransportCapabilities`. `dispatch(event)` routes each kind to the matching `on_*` handler and raises `ValueError` on an unknown kind. Handlers:

- `on_turn_start()` — default no-op, called once before the stream begins.
- `on_text_chunk(text)`, `on_thinking(text)` — abstract.
- `on_tool_call(tool_call_id, title, tool_kind="", tool_purpose="")` — abstract; mirrors native uniform tool-call semantics (each call marks the previous task complete and starts a new in-progress task).
- `on_prompt_choice(options, request_id)` — abstract; renders the interactive approval/choice prompt.
- `on_compaction(context_usage_pct)`, `on_done(stop_reason="")` — abstract.
- `on_steer_consumed(summary="")` — default no-op; Discord/Telegram seal the pre-steer segment and open the continuation with a native acknowledgement chip using the parsed summary, without receiving raw protocol text.

### `SilentRenderer` — enforcing a dashboard channel disconnect

A `Renderer` whose handlers are all no-ops, substituted for the real renderer when
the conversation has been **disconnected** in the dashboard (see the pause markers
in [session](session.md)). Disconnect means "stop talking to me there": the turn
STILL RUNS and the inbound message still lands in the session, because the binding
is retained and the dashboard is where that user is now working — only the writes
back to the muted conversation are dropped, including the typing indicator.

`dispatch.delivery_is_muted(sessions, session_key, channel_type)` is the single
predicate; `conversation_is_muted(sessions, turn)` delegates to it for the shared
pipeline. It resolves origin-vs-mirror from the turn itself (a channel-born
session's key IS its conversation, so a turn arriving in that namespace is the
origin; anything else came over a mirror/resume binding) and fails OPEN, matching
the dashboard-side predicates — a muted conversation that stays noisy is a visible
bug, a live conversation silently dead is worse.

**Every inbound pipeline must consult it.** `drive_turn` does, but Discord and
Telegram run their OWN copies of the turn loop, so each substitutes independently;
a new channel that skips this ships a dashboard control with nothing behind it.
Two contracts matter for the substitute: its `close` accepts `*args/**kwargs`
because a channel may WIDEN that signature (Telegram passes `failure_reason`), and
it must be the object that is **closed**, not merely the one streamed to — a
concrete renderer's `close` posts an error placeholder when a turn produced no
output, which a muted turn always did. It is also deliberately NOT published into a
dispatcher's `_active_renderers`, which silences the mid-turn steer chip and keeps
channel-local APIs (`note_steer`) off the shared class. Slack never reaches these
pipelines — it drives its own gateway and is gated by `slack_mirror_is_paused`.

### `chunk_text(text, max_chars) -> list[str]`

Pure helper Renderers use to honor `capabilities.max_message_chars`. Returns `[]` for empty input; a non-positive `max_chars` disables chunking (single chunk); otherwise splits into `max_chars`-sized pieces. Together with the `max_buttons` cap this is how a renderer *degrades* an over-cap message or choice set for a lower-capability channel.

## Fence-safe splitting (`split.py`)

`split_markdown_safe(text, limit, *, reserve=0) -> list[str]` is the shared markdown splitter every channel converges on. `chunk_text` above is blind fixed-width and the remaining per-channel splitters (Telegram's `_split_text`/`_split_markdown`, `slack/format.py::split_message`, the Webex and Weixin helpers) each carry their own fence handling, so a fix landed in one never reached the others. The module is stdlib-only and pure — no config objects, no modes.

Its contract:

- **Budget.** Every chunk is at most `limit - reserve` characters; `reserve` holds back capacity for a suffix the caller appends to each chunk. Empty text → `[]`. Text that already fits, a non-positive `limit`, and a `reserve` that consumes the whole budget → `[text]`. Lengths are Python `str` characters, not bytes or UTF-16 units. One documented exception: a logical line that admits no cut clean on both sides is placed **whole** rather than cut into a fabricated fence delimiter, whenever the **line itself** is no longer than `limit` — such a chunk holds that one line and nothing else. Eligibility measures the line alone, so the chunk adds its fence scaffolding (the reopener line, and the newline plus synthetic closer) on top and may pass `limit` by exactly that scaffolding; a chunk with no scaffolding to carry stays within `limit`. A bounded oversize is the accepted price of never fabricating a delimiter. Which placement a line takes is decided from the line and `limit` alone, before any budget arithmetic (remaining room, the reserved closer, what the chunk already holds) gets a say, so a cut without a clean boundary is reachable only for a line longer than `limit` — eligibility written as a guard along one arithmetic path is what made the ladder bypassable at budgets a fence's scaffolding consumes whole.
- **Real fence grammar.** An opener is ≤3 spaces of indent plus a run of ≥3 backticks or tildes (a backtick fence's info string may not contain a backtick); a closer is a run of the SAME character at least as long with nothing else on the line. Fence content is **opaque**, so a ``` line inside a ````diff block is content — the backtick-parity counters in the per-channel splitters get exactly this wrong and invert their open/closed state for the rest of the message.
- **Language-tag carry.** A cut inside a fence seals the chunk with a synthetic closer (same char, matching length) and reopens the next chunk with the original opener line, info string and indent included. The closer's cost is budgeted while inside a fence, so sealing can never push a chunk over — except after a whole-line placement, which deliberately does not reserve it (see Budget above).
- **Prefix stability (the streaming contract).** Splitting is greedy left-to-right and every cut depends only on the text BEFORE it, so re-splitting a longer prefix of the same stream reproduces every chunk except the last one byte-for-byte. A streaming caller sends sealed chunks as they appear and keeps only the final chunk as a live buffer. This outranks cut-quality heuristics: a nicer cut point that has to peek at the line after the cut is not allowed.
- **Cut preference.** Outside a fence: paragraph break if one sits at least halfway into the budget, else the last line break if it sits at least a quarter in, else a hard cut filling the budget (Discord's `limit//2` / `limit//4` ladder). Inside a fence: line boundaries only, hard-cutting a line only when it cannot fit a chunk at all. A hard cut splits one line across a chunk boundary, so **both** halves start a rendered line and the cut is pulled back until neither invents a fence: the prefix must leave the fence state untouched, and the remainder must not begin with indent or a fence character (judged by its first character alone — parsing a remainder that is still arriving would move an already-sealed cut). A fragment where every candidate lands inside a run admits no such cut, and the residue policy has two tiers: the line is placed **whole**, in a chunk holding it and nothing else, whenever the **line itself** is no longer than the caller's full `limit` — measured on the line alone, so the chunk carries its fence scaffolding on top of `limit` rather than cutting the line to make room (see Budget above); only a logical line longer than `limit`, undeliverable whole at any budget the caller allows, falls back to the widest prefix-clean cut, where the deferred remainder can still read as a delimiter. That last case is documented degradation in the same regime as an under-sized budget, and it now requires a single unbreakable line longer than the whole limit — not merely a no-clean-cut fragment that outgrew the current chunk, and not one whose fence scaffolding pushed the scaffolded sum over. The whole-line placement is reached by sealing the buffered chunk first, and that seal is keyed on cut cleanliness alone, never on the line's length: a seal driven by a line still arriving would move once the rest of it landed, rewriting a chunk already sent.
- **Whitespace.** Leading whitespace is never stripped (stripping it silently re-indents split code). Trailing whitespace is trimmed only when sealing outside a fence, where it cannot be content.
- **Tables.** A trailing pipe-bearing line is pushed to the next chunk when an earlier cut is nearby, which keeps a header row with its separator row; otherwise table lines are plain lines. Full table conversion stays with the per-channel renderers.
- **Termination.** Pathological input — a single unbreakable 10k-char line, a 5000-backtick run, a budget too small to hold a line's own fence scaffolding — terminates, at worst emitting over-budget chunks rather than spinning. Whole-line placement seals progress by consuming the line; the dirty-cut fallback keeps a width of at least one character. The **final** chunk of an unclosed fence is left open on purpose: callers own final presentation, and a streaming caller still holds it as a live buffer.

Discord is the first channel routed onto it, at two call sites, and it owns no fence grammar of its own: `discord/renderer.py::_rotate_on_length` consumes the streaming contract directly (seal every chunk but the last, retain the last as the live buffer, nothing appended to it and so nothing to strip back off), and `discord/session_resume.py::_replay_preview` takes the FIRST chunk as a bounded preview of a replayed transcript message, which is sealed and therefore closes any block the shortening opened. Both async call sites await `asyncio.to_thread(split_markdown_safe, …)`: the splitter terminates on pathological delimiter input, but its CPU work must not pause Discord heartbeats or unrelated turns on the event-loop thread. The remaining channels route on in follow-up changes; `test/test_messaging_split.py` pins each contract item above and `test/test_discord.py::TestRotationSplitting` pins the integration.

**A caller owes the bounded-overlimit case an answer.** The whole-line placement above can hand back a chunk over `limit` by its fence scaffolding, so a channel whose transport truncates silently must bound it again against the platform's own cap. Discord does: `_limit()` holds 100 characters back below the 2000-char cap, which absorbs ordinary scaffolding, and `renderer._fit_platform_cap` slices anything still over the cap at the single seal chokepoint. Blind fixed-width slicing is the right last resort there — it keeps every authored character at the price of a boundary Markdown may render badly, where `client.send_message`'s own truncation would drop the tail including the synthetic closer and give the user no signal. Session replay has a different tradeoff because it is only a preview: `_replay_preview` passes at most twice the delivery limit of redacted text to the prefix-stable splitter, uses the full redacted length to retain the truncation marker, and emits that marker alone when one pathological fence cannot fit with its closer. The canonical transcript remains untouched.

`iter_fence_spans(text) -> Iterator[tuple[int, int]]` is the same machine viewed over a whole message instead of one chunk's line fragments: it yields the character spans that lie inside a fenced block, opener line through closer line, with an unclosed fence running to the end. Both it and `split_markdown_safe` drive the module's single `_advance` state machine, so the open/close rule — which run length closes which fence character — exists once. A consumer that needs "is this offset inside code?" uses it rather than re-deriving the rule; the fence regexes stay private.

## Outbound file extraction (`outbound_files.py`)

An agent that produces an image writes it into the reply as markdown — `![chart](/tmp/chart.png)`. The dashboard renders that inline; a chat channel delivers the raw text, so the user reads a filesystem path where the picture should be. `extract_local_refs(text, *, limits=None) -> ExtractResult` pulls those references out for a transport to upload, and is the channel-neutral half of that: it decides which local references are safe to send, rewrites the text without them, and reports every refusal. The upload itself stays per-channel — each transport has its own multipart shape, per-file ceiling and count limit. `extract_local_refs_off_loop` is the async form; extraction reads files, so an async caller uses it rather than blocking the gateway's single loop.

`ExtractResult` carries `rewritten_text`, `files: list[OutboundFile]`, and `rejections: list[Rejection]`. An `OutboundFile` is `(path, data, alt, mime)` with `size_bytes` derived from `data`. A `Rejection` is `(dest, reason, detail)`, where `reason` is one of the module's `REASON_*` codes and `str()` renders the default prose. `ExtractLimits` sets the per-message budgets: `max_files` (references considered), `max_total_bytes` (aggregate, and the memory bound), and an optional `max_file_bytes` for a channel whose per-file ceiling sits below the aggregate.

Its contract:

- **Reference-bearing text reaches extraction before any splitter.** A caller may seal an ordinary prefix that ends before the earliest local reference, but it MUST hold the reference and its suffix intact for extraction; handing `![alt](path)` to a length splitter first can strand half a link in each chunk, unrecognisable to any later pass and visible as broken markdown. Extraction also shrinks the text that still needs final platform splitting.
- **Transports upload `OutboundFile.data` and MUST NOT re-open `path`.** Every gate below is applied to one inode, and a path resolved a second time at upload can name a different file by then — anything able to write that directory in between (another turn, a subagent, a cron) would substitute what gets sent. `path` is provenance: the filename to put on the upload, and what a log line or a rejection names.
- **A reference inside balanced inline code or a code fence is literal.** Inline spans reuse the length-preserving balanced-backtick masker used by rendered-block parsing; fenced offsets come from `iter_fence_spans` above, so neither grammar is re-derived here.
- **Only a real raster is sent.** Type comes from the leading bytes via `messaging/raster.py`, never an extension: a shell script named `.png` is refused, and SVG is scriptable markup with no signature. The same table decides inbound sniffing, so the two directions cannot disagree about a file.
- **The security floor is applied per reference**, because reply text is not trustworthy input — a prompt-injected agent chooses what it writes. Async channel extraction requires the acquired provider's actual `cwd` as its approved root; a path lexically outside that root is refused before metadata probes, and `safe_read_file_bytes_nolink(..., within_root=cwd)` rechecks the opened descriptor so a parent-symlink race cannot escape it. The existing `is_sensitive_path` denylist still applies; symlinks, hardlinks, and non-regular files are refused.
- **Every refusal is returned, never swallowed**, and the refused reference keeps its original markup so the path stays visible in the message. A file dropped in silence leaves a reply that talks about a picture with no picture and no explanation — the defect this module exists to prevent. This holds for a per-file-cap refusal too, so a channel with a low ceiling never has to drop an already-stripped file after the fact.
- **Caps bound work, not just output.** `max_files` counts references *examined*, so a reply full of unreadable paths cannot drive unbounded filesystem work or an unbounded rejection list. `max_total_bytes` is handed to the read itself, so an oversize file is refused rather than allocated, and `max_file_bytes` narrows that same read when a channel's ceiling is lower.

`test/test_outbound_files.py` pins each contract item above. Discord is the first channel routed onto it (below) and Microsoft Teams the second (see "Teams' file halves"); the remaining channels follow, and until one does its `files_outbound` stays `False` and it keeps printing paths. An adopter may be NARROWER than this module — Teams accepts only the raster subtypes it can render inline — but the one contract item it may not restate is the refusal: a reference this module accepted and the channel then cannot send must still be reported, and the path must still be visible.

`iter_local_refs(text) -> list[LocalRef]` is the scan both consumers share — every complete reference decidable from the text alone (inline-code and fenced ones, malformed markup and remote/`data:` destinations already excluded). `open_ref_start(text)` reports where markup OPENS and never closes, and `protected_ref_spans(text)` is the union of the two: the single answer to "where is image markup", used by the rotation guard and by `hide_local_refs(text) -> str`, the text-only cut a streaming channel uses to keep markup off live frames. An unterminated opener owns the rest of the text, because a buffer chunked while the reply is still arriving legitimately ends mid-markup — protecting only complete references is what lets a cut bisect `![alt](` and lose the attachment. `hide_local_refs` is deliberately more permissive than `extract_local_refs`: a reference it hides but extraction then rejects reappears in the sealed message, which is the safe direction; the reverse would flash a path and vanish.

### Discord's upload half (`discord/`)

The first channel wired onto the module, and the shape the others follow:

- **Named ceilings fed in as budgets, on a multipart path that shares the JSON ladder.** `client.py` declares `DISCORD_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (10 MiB), `DISCORD_MAX_FILES_PER_MESSAGE` (10) and `DISCORD_MAX_TOTAL_UPLOAD_BYTES` (25 MiB — Discord's own total is below files × per-file, so the aggregate is what bounds the bytes one seal holds); the renderer turns them into `ExtractLimits`, so an oversize file is refused *by the read* and keeps its markup instead of being uploaded and 413'd, or dropped after its reference was already cut out. `_api_multipart` sits beside `_api` and both run through one `_api_request`, so the 429 back-off, the non-JSON-body degradation and the transport-error logging exist once. The body is rebuilt per attempt because an aiohttp form is consumed as it is written — replaying one sends an empty body. `payload_json` leads, then one `files[N]` part each, with an `attachments` descriptor list built where the parts are so a descriptor's `id` always names its own part.
- **Only semantic seals extract, once.** Before any length rotation, the earliest complete or still-arriving local reference and its suffix stay in the live tail; the preceding ordinary text may seal through the shared splitter, but length-sealed chunks never run extraction. The semantic steer/final seal therefore sees the reference atomically in its original whole-text fence context and uploads each file exactly once. The shared splitter documents one context-degrading tier, reachable only for a logical line longer than the full limit; if that tier is entered before a later image appears, the segment remains upload-ineligible and its markup stays literal. Both the protected-span scan on rotation and `hide_local_refs` on live frames run off-loop; neither can starve the gateway on adversarial markup. An image-only reply ships as an attachment with no raw path.
- **A failed upload restores display-redacted markup.** Discord takes every file in one multipart call, so failure is all-or-nothing. Before fallback splitting or JSON sends, the original segment runs through display-form redaction; ordinary safe image markup is restored verbatim, while markup that concealed a credential may intentionally lose formatting to keep the rendered secret redacted. Recovery splits against Discord's real `DISCORD_MAX_TEXT` ceiling with the shared splitter, then applies the hard-cap fallback for its documented scaffolding exception, so authored tails are never silently truncated.
- **Descriptions, filenames, and transformed body text are separate sinks.** Extraction unescapes alt text, so descriptions are re-scanned with the exfiltration and credential pair across both literal and canonical display forms before truncation. Filenames keep only a sanitized basename and normalize the extension to the sniffed type. Removing image markup can also reassemble a credential through Markdown that Discord hides; the transformed body therefore scans both its invisible-character-normalized literal form and canonical display form with both redactors before selective mention neutralization. The literal pass keeps a retained/rejected image destination visible to the scanner even when link canonicalization would remove it.
- **Two gates, both leaving the text untouched when they refuse, and every refusal is audited.** `files_outbound` is read before extracting, so a channel without an upload path keeps printing the path rather than silently dropping the picture. The second is the restricted-session ceiling: an approved guild thread is readable by every member who can view it, so a session the user expected to leave no trace must not ship bytes into one. A LIVE dashboard slot answers off the same `slot.is_restricted` signal that denies artifact registration; when the tab has been ARCHIVED the slot and its restricted key are both gone while the mirror binding persists, so the gate resolves the transcript's own `memory_mode` off-loop through `_probe_persisted_session` — which REFUSES to answer when one stem matches several transcripts, since taking the first candidate would let a legacy persistent file answer for an incognito session — and denies on restricted, ambiguous OR unreadable. A key that is not `dashboard:` is a Discord-native conversation that never had a slot, and stays allowed — fail-closed there would disable uploads for every normal Discord session. Restricted-session denials use `discord_dispatch.upload_files`; extraction refusals use `discord_renderer.upload_files` with only their closed reason codes and counts, never the LLM-authored destination.

## Per-target table rendering (`tables.py`)

A GFM pipe table is unreadable on a channel that renders Markdown but not tables: the pipes arrive literally and every column wraps, so on a phone a three-column table becomes a wall of ragged text. `render_tables(text, *, policy, native_tables=False, final=True)` converts it into something the channel can render. Stdlib-only and pure, like `split.py`.

**It is an OUTBOUND presentation transform, not a rewrite of the turn.** The canonical assistant text — what `TurnDriver.run` returns, and therefore what the transcript, history and the dashboard show — never passes through it. A renderer applies it to the bytes it is about to hand its platform client, so the same turn keeps pipes on the dashboard and gets cards on Discord. Each channel's `text()`/`_segment_text()` accessor stays canonical for the same reason: those also feed history.

**Policy is per delivery TARGET, never per session.** `TransportCapabilities.table_mode` carries the target's declaration and `Renderer.render_tables_for_target()` resolves it against `TransportCapabilities.native_tables`, so a session mirrored to two channels can send pipes to one and cards to the other.

| Policy | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `off` | No conversion. The floor, so a channel that never opts in is byte-unchanged |
| `cards` | One card per row: first column as a bold heading, later headers as labels |
| `grid` | An aligned monospace grid inside a fenced code block |
| `native` | The target renders tables itself, so pass through — **but only when it really does** |
| `auto` | Per table: a grid while its DISPLAY width fits `GRID_MAX_DISPLAY_COLUMNS` (42), cards once it does not |

`resolve_table_policy(policy, native_tables=…)` is the capability check, and it exists for one case: **`native` on a target declaring `native_tables=False` resolves to `cards`, never to raw pipes.** `auto` on a native target resolves to `off` (the platform's own table beats anything rendered here); explicit `cards`/`grid` are operator intent and are honoured on any target; an unknown policy normalizes to `auto` rather than `off`, because the unsafe fallback is the one that ships pipes.

Per-channel declarations:

| Channel | `native_tables` | `table_mode` | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discord, Teams, Webex | `False` | `auto` | Markdown but no table rendering; delivery can split safe cards across messages |
| WeCom | `False` | `off` | One replacement bubble has no continuation path, so no adaptive form can guarantee both display safety and complete delivery under its hard cap |
| Telegram | `True` | `native` | `sendRichMessage` renders a real table, and `_seal_table_fallback` monospaces the run when that path is unavailable |
| Weixin | `True` | `native` | iLink renders Markdown natively, which `weixin/renderer.py` deliberately preserves |
| Slack | `False` | `off` | Renders no table, but `slack/format.py::_convert_tables` already flattens on the render path and the golden-transcript harness pins those bytes |

Contract details:

- **Display width, not `len`.** `display_width` counts East Asian `W`/`F` as two columns and combining marks and zero-width characters as none. Padding by `len` produces a grid whose columns visibly step, and thresholding by `len` sends a CJK table twice the viewport width down the grid path.
- **Conservative.** Anything not unambiguously a GFM table is left byte-for-byte alone: prose, a pipe-bearing sentence, a line indented by 4+ display columns with spaces or tab expansion (that is code), a malformed table whose separator row's cell count does not match its header's, a Markdown block starter in any table position (including a dash-list item that otherwise resembles a separator), anything inside a real fenced code block, and every CommonMark raw HTML block. HTML block contents are opaque until their specified closing marker or blank-line boundary, so table-shaped source inside `<pre>`, comments, declarations, block tags, and complete custom tags is never rewritten. Fences are line-anchored per CommonMark (backtick or tilde, indent ≤3, closer run ≥ opener's, a backtick fence's info string may not contain a backtick) and their content is opaque, so a ``` inside a ````diff block is content. A fence opened after a bullet or ordered-list marker carries its container indentation through the closing delimiter, so table-shaped code in the list item remains opaque and a table after the item can still convert.
- **Post-transform safety.** When conversion changes outbound text, `Renderer.render_tables_for_target()` re-runs credential and exfiltration redaction against the display form before delivery. Cards join headers and values that `TurnDriver` scanned on separate table lines; the second pass prevents a generated `Authorization: Bearer …` label/value line, or formatting removed by the platform, from assembling a secret after the channel-neutral pass. Delivery-framing fallbacks pass an explicit `cards` policy back through this same helper; Discord, Teams and Webex never call the pure formatter directly after deciding an adaptive grid crosses their cap. `off`/supported-`native` output that did not change remains byte-identical.
- **Protocol remains canonical.** Discord keeps authored source in its protocol buffer and table-rendered text in a separate delivery snapshot. Steering rotation and trailing `[OPTIONS: …]` extraction read only canonical source; steering directives are single-line and cannot span table rows. Both final and pre-steer seals consume canonical options before rendering, and presentation output is used only for streaming, size checks, and delivery—marker-shaped card content is never reinterpreted as controls.
- **Cell boundaries.** During rendering, a pipe is content, not a boundary, when it is `\|` (decided by walking the row, so `\\|` stays a boundary) or inside an inline code span. The code-span rule is deliberately LOOSER than GFM, which would split there and leave the backticks unpaired: the decision here is only a rendering, and the alternative is silently deleting a pipe the author wrote. Shape validation remains strict GFM and counts every unescaped header pipe, including one inside a code span, so malformed header/separator widths stay byte-identical. Conversion also requires that strict GFM width to equal the lossless rendering parser's header width; an ambiguous header stays byte-identical rather than shifting or truncating body cells. An unpaired backtick opens nothing.
- **Cards preserve empty data.** The first body cell becomes a bold heading only when that cell has a value. A blank repeated-category cell stays blank while the row's remaining labeled values render; the column header is never substituted as invented row data. Empty non-heading cells are omitted rather than emitted as bare labels.
- **`[OPTIONS:` / `[STEERING` lines terminate a run.** Both carry pipes and are emitted directly under an answer, so a table one line above would otherwise swallow the trailer as a body row and render the user's choices as a card.
- **Whitespace and containers are preserved.** Whitespace outside a converted run remains exact, including blank-line runs and a trailing newline. A run's leading container indentation (up to three display columns) is carried onto every nonblank rendered line, so conversion does not pull a nested table out of its indented list context.
- **Grid fences cannot collide with cell content.** The generated backtick fence is longer than every backtick run in the aligned header and body, so a literal ``` cell remains content rather than closing the grid.
- **Idempotent.** Neither rendering contains a table run (cards carry no pipes; a grid lives inside a fence, which is never entered), so a streaming renderer may convert its buffer eagerly and re-convert what it retains.
- **Streaming (`final=False`).** A table run reaching the end of the text may still be growing, so it is left raw; the same deferral applies when the immediately following final line is unterminated, because `Row ` can become the outer-pipe-less body row `Row 1 | ok` in the next chunk. Converting either state would freeze a half-arrived row as a card and strand the rows behind it. A run terminated by settled real content converts either way. Discord treats the difference between the streaming and final render as a pending-table signal: once the header and separator are recognizable it buffers that segment and neither rotates nor updates the live frame until prose terminates the run or the turn finishes. A separator split across provider chunks may therefore leave one earlier partial-pipe frame visible briefly, but the completed send edits that same message to the rendered table; no recognized table is split into raw rows.
- **Degenerate cases.** A header-only run renders as a grid regardless of policy (there is no row to make a card from, and dropping it would lose the run's only content). The same lossless fallback applies when a nonempty body's sparse rows produce no card lines: the grid preserves both headers and empty cells instead of replacing the table with nothing.

Discord converts INTO its buffer rather than at the send seam, because `_rotate_on_length` sizes messages from that buffer and cards are longer than the pipes they replace; converting on the way out could seal a message past the platform's hard 2000-char cap. A still-growing trailing table remains buffered even when it grows beyond one message, then the completed output is split normally — no rotation may strand headerless raw rows. When a generated grid itself exceeds one Discord segment, Discord first re-renders it as cards: the shared splitter reopens a cut fence with its original opener, so a split grid stays valid Markdown but its header row reaches only the first message, while cards stay readable on their own. Teams and Webex likewise re-render a narrow grid as independently readable cards before their normal character/byte chunking when it would cross one platform message. If forced cards retain an over-cap grid, those split-capable targets preserve display-safe raw table text through ordinary continuation chunking instead; generated-grid metadata prevents this fallback from downgrading valid cards. WeCom keeps canonical table text because its streamed answer has no continuation-bubble path: a transformed form can exceed the hard cap while the only shorter raw candidate still contains a value that display-form redaction would remove.

`test/test_messaging_tables.py` pins the pure contract; `test/test_channel_table_rendering.py` pins which target converts, that the driver's canonical text does not, and the `native`-without-the-capability coercion.

## Layer 3 — session-key namespacing (`link.py`)

Session keys are namespaced as `f"{channel_type}:{conversation_id}"` (`session_key()`) so keys never collide across channels (`SLACK_NAMESPACE = "slack"`). Legacy native-Slack sessions were keyed by the bare `thread_ts`; helpers provide the bidirectional `bare ⇄ slack:` shim consumed by `SessionMap` (`session_map.py` imports `ChannelLink` + `canonical_key`, no import cycle):

- `is_legacy_slack_key(key)` — True iff `key` is a bare Slack `thread_ts` (matched by `_SLACK_TS_RE = r"\d+\.\d+"`, digits + one dot).
- `canonical_key(key)` — normalizes a bare legacy key to `slack:<thread>`; non-legacy keys (`dashboard:`, `channel:`, `slack:`, …) pass through unchanged. `SessionMap._load` (called from `__init__`) migrates bare keys and populates a Layer-3 `ChannelLink`; `get()`/`set()` re-canonicalize so a not-yet-updated caller passing a bare `thread_ts` still resolves.
- `legacy_key(key)` — returns the bare `thread_ts` for a `slack:<thread>` key, else `None`.

`ChannelLink(channel_type, channel_id=None, thread_id=None)` records the inbound channel a session belongs to (its **own** channel), with `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`. It is deliberately distinct from the dashboard→Slack *mirror* binding, which stays behind `SessionMap.get/set_slack_link` and is **not** modeled here (guardrail G3).

## Config flag & routing

`MessagingConfig.use_transport` (`config/loader.py`, default `True` in Kiro Crew; exposed in `config.json` under `messaging`) is the single switch. `slack/events.py::_route_message` checks `orch._cfg.messaging.use_transport`; when `True` it creates a task on `handle_message_transport` and skips the native `handle_message` monolith. (There is no challenge-redirect in this fork — Slack messages are processed inline.) Approval mode is resolved by `_resolve_approval_mode(orch)` (respects configured mode + operator YOLO/SafetyOverride TTL), and the per-channel `slack.channels.<id>.agent` override is passed through.

## Telegram forum topics (per-Topic sessions)

A Telegram **supergroup with Topics enabled** maps onto the same `thread_id`
abstraction Slack uses, so one bot serves many parallel, topic-scoped sessions
(Slack channel+threads) instead of a single session per user.

- **Routing / session key.** The transport captures each update's
  `message_thread_id` (the Topic id) and carries it as the neutral
  `InboundMessage.thread_id`. The dispatcher folds `(chat_type, chat_id,
  thread_id)` into a route and reuses the `chat_type` slot of
  `build_dm_session_key`: a Topic keys to
  `telegram:{agent}:forum:{chat_id}:{thread_id}`, while a private DM stays
  byte-for-byte `telegram:{agent}:direct:{user_id}`. `messaging.dm_scope="unified"`
  collapses **only** direct DMs into the `unified:{agent}` bucket — forum routes
  always keep the full per-Topic key, so no group Topic can share a session with
  a DM or another group.
- **Per-Topic generation.** `ConversationState` is keyed on the same route, so
  `/new`, idle/daily rotation and `/compact` are scoped to one Topic.
- **Gate — fail-closed AND Topic-scoped.** `forum_gate_outcome(chat_type,
  chat_id, message_thread_id, *, allow_forum, allowed_forum_chat_ids)` is the
  single predicate guarding **both** `TelegramTransport.receive` (frozen
  allow-list) and `TelegramDispatcher.on_callback` (live cfg). It authorizes a
  turn/callback only for a real forum Topic — `chat_type == "supergroup"` AND a
  `message_thread_id` — in an allow-listed chat (`telegram.allow_forum` **and**
  `chat_id ∈ telegram.allowed_forum_chat_ids`). Ordinary groups and the
  supergroup **General** chat (no thread) are denied and SEL-audited
  (`denied_forum_not_allowed` / `denied_non_private_chat`); the owner
  `allowed_user_ids` check still gates *who* may drive a turn.
- **Outbound.** Streamed answers, command/notice replies, queue receipts, the
  queue drain, callback re-dispatch, and the `/link` dashboard-mirror
  `ChannelLink` all carry `message_thread_id`, so every reply lands in its Topic
  and a queued message drains under the forum key (`editMessageText` is not
  threaded — the message id already identifies the message within its Topic).

## Mid-turn routing, queue receipts & cancel

A message that arrives while a turn is still generating is not a new turn: the
session semaphore is held, so running it directly would either block or open a
second conversation against the same key. Three channels carry the full
steer/queue/drain machinery — `telegram/transport_dispatch.py`,
`discord/transport_dispatch.py` and `teams/transport_dispatch.py`; all read the
same `messaging.queue_mode` (`config/loader.py`, `"steer"` | `"queue"`, anything
else normalized to `steer`) and all implement the same three primitives
(`_handle_busy`, `_enqueue_with_receipt` + `_drain_queue`, `_handle_stop`).

The **channel-neutral half of the queue receipt is shared**, not duplicated:
`messaging/queue_receipt.py` owns the receipt registry, the lock, the three
lifecycle transitions and the receipt body formatting. Each channel reaches it
through a `ReceiptSurface` whose address is bound at construction, which is why
the shared module never sees a `chat_id` / `channel_id` / forum thread and
Telegram's forum routing stays entirely channel-local. `_handle_busy` and
`_drain_queue` deliberately stay per-channel: they re-enter their own
`handle_message` (whose signature differs per channel) and own the per-channel
`_active_renderers`. `_handle_stop` is NOT in that exclusion — see
[Where a command handler splits](#where-a-command-handler-splits).

The remaining channels (Webex, WeCom, Weixin) implement `_handle_busy` as
**steer-only**: they fold the message into the running turn and reply with a
one-shot notice, or ask the user to resend when steer is unavailable. They have
no receipt and no drain because their reply is bound to the inbound request
(WeCom, Weixin) or their edit budget is already spent on the answer itself
(Webex caps a message at ten edits), so a hold-then-deliver follow-up turn could
not be acknowledged and delivered reliably later.

**Teams is NOT in that group**, and the distinction is the editable-receipt
affordance rather than channel maturity: the Bot Framework Connector supports
`PUT {serviceUrl}/v3/conversations/{id}/activities/{activityId}` for a bot's own
activities, so `TeamsClient.update_message` can grow one receipt bubble in place
exactly as Telegram and Discord do. Teams therefore carries the full machinery.
The one thing it cannot borrow is the delivery receipt: a bot cannot ADD a
reaction in Teams (`messageReaction` activities are inbound-only), so a
successful mid-turn steer is acknowledged with a short message where Telegram and
Discord use an emoji — one extra bubble, which is still strictly better than
losing the message.

### `steer` (the default): fold into the running turn

`_handle_busy` injects the text into the in-flight turn via kiro-cli's
`_session/steer` ext-method. The write is fire-and-forget: the turn's read loop
is the single consumer of that process's stdout, so awaiting the response would
steal the turn's own messages. kiro-cli folds the steer at its next generation
boundary (a tool-call edge on an agentic turn, the end of stream on one long
text turn) and emits an inline `[STEERING steer-<id>: <ack summary>]` marker in
the text stream at the exact fold point.

Two preconditions gate the steer, and both matter:

- `provider.supports_steer` — membership in `ACP_BACKENDS_STEER`, since the
  dormant Claude backend seam has no `_session/steer`. When false the message
  falls through to the queue path.
- `provider.has_active_turn()`, **not** `sessions.is_busy()`. `is_busy` stays
  true through post-turn bookkeeping (success record, turn persist, threshold
  notice, SEL audit, all await points), so it alone cannot distinguish a live
  turn from one that just ended. Steering an already-ended prompt is silently
  swallowed, which would leave the user with an acknowledgement and no answer.

On a successful steer the user's own message gets an emoji **reaction** as the
delivery receipt (`setMessageReaction` on Telegram, `add_reaction` on Discord;
both declare `reactions=True` in their `TransportCapabilities`). A reaction and
not a reply, so a mid-turn steer costs no extra bubble in the transcript. The
dispatcher also records the user's own words on the live renderer via
`note_steer` so the rendered chip quotes the user rather than the redacted
backend echo.

Attachments force the queue path on Discord: `_session/steer` carries text only,
so a mid-turn message with files would lose them.

### `queue`: one collapsing receipt, then ONE combined turn

In `queue` mode (or under a per-message override, or when steer is unavailable)
the message is held and surfaced through a **single** receipt message that grows
in place:

```
⏳ Queued (2): "what time is it" · "and the weather?"
```

The first five items are listed verbatim (`RECEIPT_MAX_ITEMS`), the rest
collapse into `…and N more` so a large burst cannot blow the message cap.

**The receipt is EDITED, never deleted.** At the end of the turn it flips to
`▶️ Now answering (N): …`; a `/stop` finalizes it to `🛑 Cancelled (N): …`.
Neither dispatcher calls a delete API on it. This is deliberate: the receipt is
the durable record of what the user asked and how it was routed, so deleting it
would erase the only evidence that a message was accepted at all.

The enqueue and the receipt create/grow happen together under
`ReceiptQueue.lock`, which the end-of-turn drain also takes across its dequeue
plus flip. The lock is deliberately **caller-held** rather than acquired inside
each transition (hence the `_locked` suffixes): moving the acquire inside would
read tidier and silently reintroduce the orphaned-bubble race. That is
what makes the two race-free: the drain sees either the message queued **with**
its receipt or neither yet, never a half state that would orphan a bubble.
`enqueue(..., force=False)` is a no-op once the semaphore is free, so if the
turn finished inside the window the enqueue returns false and the caller runs
the message as a fresh turn instead of stranding it.

**Queued messages collapse into ONE turn.** `_drain_queue` dequeues the whole
burst, joins the texts with blank lines in arrival order, and runs a single
combined turn, rather than replaying N separate turns. Two caps bound the
collapse: `_MAX_COLLAPSE` (50) messages, and on Discord the ingest attachment
limit across the combined set. Once one item no longer fits, it **and everything
behind it** are re-enqueued so FIFO order stays exact, the receipt notes
`+N deferred`, and the drain loops to pump the remainder. Messages arriving
during the combined turn open a fresh receipt and drain after it.

The combined turn itself runs outside `ReceiptQueue.lock`, and the drain replays via
`handle_message(..., interpret_commands=False)`. Drained payloads therefore
bypass both the command intercept and override parsing, so a queued `/new`
reaches the model as literal text instead of executing on drain.

### Per-message overrides

A `steer` / `queue` directive prefix forces that one message down the
corresponding path, overriding `queue_mode` for that message only.
**Discord's text commands are `!`-prefixed** (`!new`, `!compact`, `!link`,
`!unlink`, `!stop`, `!help`, `!sessions`, `!queue`, `!steer`) because Discord's
client swallows a bare `/` message into its own slash-command UI; the `/` forms
are also accepted for muscle-memory parity with Telegram, which uses `/` only.

The prefix is recognized only when the original text is not itself a command,
and the payload after it is **turn content, never a command**: `/queue /new`
queues the literal text `/new`.

A bare `/steer` or `/queue` carrying no message body matches neither the command
parser nor the override parser. **Telegram** answers it with the directive's
usage, because the alternative is handing the literal string `/queue` to the
model, which then answers it as chat text — indistinguishable, to the user, from
the feature not existing. **Discord** still treats the bare token as an ordinary
message; the two channels therefore diverge on this one case until the guard is
ported.

### Hard cancel: `/stop`

`/stop` (alias `/cancel`; `!stop` / `!cancel` on Discord) aborts the running
turn, drops every queued message, and finalizes the receipt to `🛑 Cancelled`.
`clear_queue` and the receipt finalize run together under `ReceiptQueue.lock`.
All of that, including both reply strings, is
`messaging/commands.py::stop_running_turn(sessions, session_key, *, queue,
surface)`; a dispatcher supplies the session key and its bound `ReceiptSurface`
and sends the returned text.

**Cancel is cooperative before it is fatal.** The shared handler calls
`provider.cancel(wait_ack_timeout=0)`, which writes an ACP `session/cancel`
notification and returns without waiting, so the acknowledgement to the user is
immediate; the turn stops at its next safe point. Per the ACP spec the ack is
not a response to that notification, it arrives as `stopReason: "cancelled"` on
the `session/prompt` response. The client arms a cancel grace window
(`_CANCEL_GRACE_SECS`, 10s floor, raised to the caller's budget when larger) and
only treats the agent as unresponsive after it elapses. The dashboard and Slack
Stop paths go through `SessionManager.stop_turn`, which waits out
`agent.soft_stop_budget_secs` (default 10.0, clamped to [0.5, 60]) for that ack
and escalates to a hard kill plus eager respawn only on timeout or error. See
`../../architecture/design-notes/soft-stop.md`.

On a shared runtime the cooperative cancel cannot force-kill a co-tenant
process, which is why the soft path exists at all rather than always killing.

### Where a command handler splits

A dispatcher's command handler is two things welded together: a **decision**
(what the grant becomes, whether a turn was actually cancelled, how long a login
link lives, which bindings a rebind displaces) and a **send**, which needs a
`chat_id`, a `channel_id`, or a `(conversation_id, serviceUrl)` pair. The
decision half is identical across channels and is shared; only the send stays
behind. Every shared handler therefore **returns the reply text rather than
sending it** — the shape `release_conversation_location` already used — so a
user-facing string has exactly one owner.

| Command | Shared half | Per-channel half |
|---|---|---|
| `/stop` | `commands.stop_running_turn(sessions, session_key, *, queue, surface) -> str` | the send; which session key a resumed conversation stops |
| `/yolo` | `commands.run_yolo_command(arg, *, source, caller, phrasing) -> str` | the send; `source` (also the grant's audit source), the trusted `caller`, and a `YoloPhrasing` |
| `/link` | `link.rebind_conversation_location(sessions, *, key, location, unlink_command) -> str` | the send; `location` (the channel's one spelling of "this conversation"); any refusal only a resume-capable channel can hit |
| `/unlink` | `link.release_conversation_location(sessions, *, key, location, channel) -> (str, swept)` | the send; the opt-out write ordered before it; any dashboard nudge for a swept binding |
| dashboard link | `commands.parse_dashboard_ttl(arg, *, parse_duration) -> int`, `commands.format_ttl` | the command GRAMMAR — which word the TTL is (Telegram's `parse_dashboard_argument` reads the third; Teams' `/dashboard <ttl>` the second) |

Four constraints shape those signatures:

- **No address reaches `messaging/commands.py`.** It takes no `chat_id`,
  `channel_id`, `conversation_id` or thread, and reaches a receipt bubble only
  through the already-bound `ReceiptSurface`. That is what keeps Telegram's forum
  routing and Teams' service URLs channel-local, and a parameter named for one
  channel's address is how the module would acquire its first per-channel branch.
- **Command spellings are data, not prose.** A channel that renders inline code
  writes `` `/yolo on` `` where Telegram writes `/yolo on`; the two spellings are
  `YOLO_PHRASING_PLAIN` / `YOLO_PHRASING_MARKDOWN` and the `unlink_command`
  argument, so a channel picks a value instead of restating the sentence —
  restating it is how three copies drifted.
- **No word count crosses a channel boundary.** `parse_dashboard_ttl` takes the
  already-extracted ARGUMENT, never the message, because indexing into the split
  text would read one channel's grammar on another's behalf.
- **`parse_duration` is injected, not imported.** It lives in
  `dashboard/token_auth.py`, and `kiro_crew.messaging` imports nothing from
  `kiro_crew.dashboard` at any nesting depth (`test_messaging_commands.py`
  scans for it, deferred in-function imports included).

Two things deliberately stay duplicated. `_handle_busy` and `_drain_queue`
re-enter their own `handle_message`, whose signature differs per channel, and own
the per-channel `_active_renderers` (see
[queue receipts](#mid-turn-routing-queue-receipts--cancel)). And `/yolo` has no
Discord counterpart at all: Discord renders real Approve/Deny buttons, so an
out-of-band grant is not what makes tools usable there the way it is on Teams.

### Streaming and steer rotation in the renderers

Both renderers stream a turn live through one real message edited in place
(throttled frames, a transient `🔧 {tool}…` footer during tool calls, trailing
`[OPTIONS:]` markup held back from live frames), and rotate to a new message at
the driver's structured steer boundary. Telegram seals segments to Telegram-HTML
and caps source at 4000 chars; Discord sends markdown as-is and caps at 1900,
under the platform's 2000 hard limit.

At a rotation the pre-steer output **seals** as its own message and the
continuation opens a fresh message headed by a chip quoting the marker's ack
summary (falling back to the user's own steer text recorded by `note_steer`):

```
> ↪️ answered the weather question in parallel with the directory summary
<steered continuation…>
```

**The chip is lazily materialized.** `_materialize_chip` prepends it only once
real post-steer text exists in the segment, so a marker at the very end of the
stream (the steer was already covered by the answer) posts **no tail message at
all** and the reaction remains the only acknowledgement. Without the laziness
every trailing steer would leave a chip-only bubble carrying no content.

A trailing `[OPTIONS:]` block belongs to the visible pre-steer answer, so it is
extracted before the seal and shipped as a keyboard on the sealed message,
rather than frozen as literal protocol text the user cannot act on. Length
overflow rotates too, fence-balanced so a code block spanning the cut is closed
at the seal and reopened after it, with a trailing incomplete directive detached
before the split. Discord gets that from the shared `split_markdown_safe`, whose
final chunk is deliberately left open as the live buffer; Telegram still carries
its own splitter. Raw markers never reach posted text; each renderer keeps a
defensive raw-marker parser only for callers that bypass `TurnDriver`.

## Slack reference implementation

### `SlackTransport` (`slack/transport.py`)

Wraps `SlackClientOps` in the Layer-1 contract; declares Slack's real (rich-end) capabilities: `streaming/edit/reactions/files/rich_blocks/threads=True`, `max_message_chars=40000`, `max_buttons=5`. `authorize()` is **deny-by-default & owner-only** — an empty `allowed_users` frozenset (copied at construction so it can't mutate mid-decision) authorizes nobody, and every denial (including empty/missing `user_id`) is SEL-audited (`operation="slack_transport.authorize"`, `outcome="denied"`). `receive()` acks → drops bot-authored events (`bot_id` / `subtype == "bot_message"`) before authorization → normalizes to `InboundMessage` → authorizes → invokes the injected `dispatch` callback. The client is held **and exposed** via a `client` property (guardrail G2).

### `SlackRenderer` + `SlackApprovalDecider` (`slack/renderer.py`)

`SlackRenderer` maps the abstract `OutputEvent` stream onto Slack's streaming + Block Kit surface, reusing the native streaming machinery verbatim (bracket-hold `[OPTIONS:…]` filter, `_EDIT_INTERVAL` edit-throttle, `chat.update` cursor fallback when no streaming surface, `StatusReactionController` phase/emoji, per-tool task cards with a 30s elapsed timer, a timing footer at `on_done`). `on_turn_start` is idempotent (guarded by `_started`) so the dispatcher can fire the ack reaction early and the driver's later call no-ops.

`on_prompt_choice` renders `build_approval_blocks()` — three Block Kit buttons whose `action_id`s encode the request id:

| Button | `action_id` prefix | Scope |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| Approve | `mc_tool_approve_` | this tool |
| Trust session | `mc_tool_trust_` | per-session auto-approve (not global YOLO) |
| Deny | `mc_tool_deny_` | this tool |

`SlackApprovalDecider` is the `TurnDriver` `decider`: `__call__` creates a per-request future (registered in a process-global `_REGISTRY` keyed by request id), awaits it with `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT)`, and **denies by default** on timeout. The Slack interaction handler (`slack/interactions.py`) — which has no direct reference to the per-turn decider — resolves clicks via the classmethods `resolve_global(request_id, approved)` and `session_for(request_id)`; a Trust click calls `add_trusted_session()` before resolving so subsequent tools in the session are auto-approved (via the driver's `auto_approve_session` predicate).

### `handle_message_transport` (`slack/transport_dispatch.py`)

Full new-path dispatch: fires the ack reaction + working status immediately (constructing the `SlackRenderer` before the potentially slow session acquisition), acquires/creates the session, builds the message with context, then drives `TurnDriver.run()`. Agent resolution: thread override (`!agent`) → per-channel `agent_override` → configured default → the canonical `_DEFAULT_KIROCREW_AGENT = "kirocrew"` fallback (so the session loads kirocrew-core / `spawn_run` rather than kiro-cli's bare built-in default). It injects `auto_approve_tool=lambda title: _should_auto_approve_spawn(context_builder, title)` and `auto_approve_session=lambda: is_slack_session_trusted(session_key)`. Post-turn bookkeeping (context-usage accounting, conversation logging, success SEL audit) is each isolated in its own `try/except` so a bookkeeping failure never re-records a successful turn as a failure; `sessions.release()` runs in `finally`.

## Invariants

- **One-way dependency**: `kiro_crew.messaging` never imports `kiro_crew.slack` / `kiro_crew.dashboard`; violations reintroduce the cycle the abstraction removed. This holds at **any nesting depth** — a deferred in-function import is still an edge, so a shared helper that needs something from a surface takes it as a parameter (`parse_dashboard_ttl`'s `parse_duration`). `test_messaging_commands.py::TestLayering` scans the package's ASTs for it. There is exactly ONE recorded exception, and it is recorded as a `(file, module)` pair with a reason rather than as a hole in the scan: `dispatch.py`'s `build_directive_consumer` reaches `dashboard.session_directive_apply`, the SHARED applier the dashboard's own consumer uses, so the dashboard-only denial and the monitor-trio authorization chokepoint live in one place. Injecting that applier as a parameter — the pattern the TTL helper uses — would put a security boundary behind a caller-supplied callable, which is the worse trade. A companion test deletes the entry the moment the edge goes away, so the list cannot rot into a standing pre-authorization.
- **A shared command handler returns reply TEXT, never sends, and takes no address**: the send is the only per-channel half, so `stop_running_turn`, `run_yolo_command`, `rebind_conversation_location` and `release_conversation_location` all hand back a string. Nothing shared accepts a `chat_id` / `channel_id` / `conversation_id` / thread; a receipt bubble is reached only through the already-bound `ReceiptSurface`. Accepting one address would put the first per-channel branch inside the shared module and put Telegram's forum routing and Teams' service URLs back in scope for it.
- **Deny-by-default authorization**: `MessagingTransport.authorize` implementations authorize nobody when unconfigured; interactive approval denies unless positively approved (or a timeout elapses → deny).
- **Redaction is unconditional**: all LLM/tool-originated text flowing through `TurnDriver` passes `redact_exfiltration_urls()` + `redact_credentials()` before reaching any renderer.
- **Protocol metadata is not assistant speech**: streamed steering frames are withheld until complete, removed even when split across chunks, and represented as a structured boundary. Summary-bearing compaction activity is never sent to a channel as assistant speech; only a terse receipt may be rendered. `[OPTIONS: …]` remains user-facing and is never stripped by the shared filter.
- **Conservative capability defaults**: unspecified `TransportCapabilities` degrade safely (WhatsApp-like floor), and renderers must honor `max_message_chars` (`chunk_text`) and `max_buttons`.
- **Table rendering is per-target and outbound-only**: `messaging/tables.py` runs on the bytes a renderer is about to send, never on the canonical text `TurnDriver.run` returns or on the `text()` accessors that feed history — so the dashboard keeps the authored pipes while a pipes-only channel gets cards. A target may only set `table_mode=native` when its `TransportCapabilities.native_tables` is true; setting it without the capability resolves to `cards`, because raw pipes are the one output the conversion exists to prevent.
- **A media-only inbound message is a message**: a transport whose text extraction comes back empty may only drop the envelope when there are also no media items. Weixin previously returned early on empty text, so an uncaptioned screenshot was discarded with no reply and no log line — the sender saw a successful send while the agent was never told anything arrived. Emptiness is a reason to drop only when the whole envelope is empty.
- **Weixin inbound media is CDN-indirect**: iLink envelopes never carry bytes, only a `CDNMedia` reference (`encrypt_query_param` + `aes_key`) whose object is AES-128-ECB encrypted on the WeChat CDN. `weixin/media.py` owns that protocol work (URL construction with percent-encoded params, key decoding, decrypt, a streaming size cap enforced on bytes read rather than `Content-Length`); `weixin/attachments.py` maps the four CDN-backed item types onto the shared `Attachment` and hands them to `messaging/attachments.py`, which keeps classification, limits, signature validation and temp-file ownership channel-neutral. The `aes_key` field carries **two** encodings for the same value — `base64(raw 16 bytes)` for images, `base64(ascii hex)` for file/voice/video — discriminated by decoded length plus a strict hex check, because guessing wrong yields plausible garbage rather than an error. A voice item that already carries server-side `text` short-circuits the download: iLink voice is SILK, which no shipped transcription backend decodes, so the local path is strictly worse than the transcript the server gave us. `files_inbound=True` reflects this; `files_outbound` stays `False` until the `getuploadurl` + encrypted CDN PUT half lands.
- **A mid-turn queue receipt is edited, never deleted**: it flips in place to `▶️ Now answering` on drain and to `🛑 Cancelled` on `/stop`. It is the durable record that a held message was accepted, so no path may delete it.
- **A queued burst drains as ONE turn**: `_drain_queue` joins the held texts in arrival order into a single combined turn (capped by `_MAX_COLLAPSE` and, on Discord, the attachment ingest limit), never N replayed turns. Anything past a cap is re-enqueued together with everything behind it so FIFO order stays exact.
- **A mid-turn steer requires a genuinely live turn**: gate on `provider.has_active_turn()`, never on `sessions.is_busy()` alone, which stays true through post-turn bookkeeping. Steering an ended prompt is silently swallowed, producing an acknowledgement with no answer.
- **Cancel is cooperative before it is fatal**: `/stop` sends the ACP `session/cancel` notification and lets the turn stop at its next safe point; escalation to a hard kill happens only after the soft-stop budget elapses without an ack. On a shared runtime the cooperative path is the only one that cannot take a co-tenant down with it.
- **Transport shutdown is quiescent**: a client that fast-acks inbound work in background tasks cancels and awaits those tasks before closing their shared network session or returning from shutdown. Teams owns this ordering in `TeamsClient.close()`, so a gateway teardown cannot leave a turn unwinding against an already-closed Connector session.
- **A dropped outbound send is loud, never a return value**: `TeamsClient._post_activity` raises `TeamsSendError`. Every caller treats a return as proof of delivery — the renderer records the answer as sent, a proactive leg reports it delivered — so swallowing the failure is what makes the gateway claim a message the user never saw. Callers that genuinely tolerate failure (typing, an in-place edit, a command acknowledgement) catch it explicitly at their own call site, which is where the tolerance is a decision rather than a default.
- **A self-authenticating external webhook is exempt from CSRF, method-scoped, and from nothing else**: the Bot Framework Connector sends no `Origin` and no `Referer`, and `check_origin` has no configuration that admits a no-Origin non-loopback POST, so without the exemption the route 403s before its own JWT gate can run. The exemption covers `POST` only, leaves `host_validation_middleware` untouched, and is sound precisely because the handler ignores cookies — the threat CSRF addresses does not exist on it. **The set holds exactly one path.** `/api/hooks/agent` shares the shape and has the separate token-auth bypass, but is NOT Origin-exempt: skipping the cookie gate and skipping the Origin check are two different grants, no reported failure named the second for that route, and a perimeter exemption is far harder to withdraw once a caller depends on it than to add later with its own cause. Adding a path to that set is a security review, not a copied line.
- **Inbound token validation is never reordered behind body USE**: `on_activity` verifies the bearer token before the activity is acted on, and the replay-dedupe check runs AFTER the `serviceUrl` attestation so an unattested activity cannot consume a dedupe slot. The body IS read and JSON-parsed first, under a byte cap — that is what bounds it — so the guarantee is about dispatch, not about reading. A hardening step added ahead of the token check would make the perimeter the trust boundary instead of the signature.
- **Channel identity is asserted POSITIVELY**: `activity.channelId` must equal `msteams`, never "not some other channel". An Azure Bot resource serves Web Chat (enabled by default) and can serve Direct Line off the SAME endpoint with the SAME credential, and on Direct Line the client composes the `from` object — so a negative test would hand a sender-chosen identity to `allowed_emails`, and would fail open on the next channel Microsoft adds.
- **An approval widget carries a per-prompt nonce, minted from one place**: ACP request ids restart at 1 in every provider process, so a control left in a chat from a previous run names an id that is live again for a DIFFERENT tool. Slack, Discord, Telegram and Teams all mint through `messaging.renderer.new_approval_nonce`, compare with `secrets.compare_digest`, retire the nonce with the prompt, and fail CLOSED when none was armed. Three independent copies of that is how one ends up with a weaker token or none at all — which is the state Telegram shipped in. The session picker's nonce (`PickerRegistry.mint`) comes from the same function: a press on a stale list of sessions is the same hazard, so it is not a reason for a second generator.
- **Session resume has ONE routing machine, not one per channel**: `messaging/session_resume.py` owns the eligibility list, the picker registry, the conflict rules and the routing + settlement state machine; Discord and Teams supply only a `ResumeSurface` (post/settle/say + display redaction) and a `ResumeCopy` (their command spellings). The machine is where a mistake routes somebody's transcript into someone else's chat, and its hazard is timing: between the durable record read and the live session-map read a binding can appear, vanish or move, so ONE call returns ONE `RoutingDecision` — where the message runs, the refusal that stops it, and the settlement owed once that refusal is delivered. Two resolver calls with an await between them let the binding change in the gap and the routing check fall through to the conversation's own session, silently. A second copy of that is not a maintenance cost, it is a second chance to get it wrong.
- **There is ONE auto-approve grant, and a channel does not get its own**: every surface that can arm it — the dashboard toggle, `/yolo` on seven channels, and Teams' approval card — goes through `safety_override` via `messaging.commands.run_yolo_command`. A channel-local trusted set is a second grant with its own lifetime, its own audit trail and its own answer to "is YOLO on?", and it has to reimplement the expiry, renewal and auditing the shared helper already owns. Slack's `is_slack_session_trusted` predates this and is the one exception; a new channel follows the seven. It also follows that a control which arms the grant must NAME its blast radius: Teams' button says "Approve + auto-approve", not "Trust session", because the effect reaches every surface until the grant expires.
- **A model-authored label is never interpreted as a command**: an `[OPTIONS:]` chip re-dispatches with `interpret_commands=False`, exactly like a drained queue payload. Display redaction does not strip a leading `/`, so with interpretation on a model that emitted `[OPTIONS: /dashboard | cancel]` renders a chip whose single tap mints a dashboard login credential.
- **Attachment ingest belongs to the frame that awaits the turn**: download after the busy check, in the dispatcher, and unlink in that frame's `finally`. Ingesting at arrival and unlinking there leaves a QUEUED message's prompt naming files that were deleted minutes before the drained turn read them, and the encoder skips a missing path silently. It follows that an attachment-bearing message is never steered (a steer carries text only) and never read as a command (the caption lives in `text`); the queue entry carries RAW descriptors and the drained turn re-ingests them.
- **An outbound refusal is never budget-dropped**: when extraction has already CUT a reference's markup, its refusal line is the only surviving trace of the file, so it is appended unconditionally and the caller chunks. Trading the line for staying inside one message is the one outcome that leaves the user with neither the picture nor a reason.
- **A permanently undeliverable route is dropped, a transient failure is not**: `TeamsSendError` carries the Connector status and only `403`/`404` retire the persisted `serviceUrl`. Keeping a dead route turns every later cron result and mirror leg into a red badge nothing can clear; dropping one on a hiccup makes an outage look permanent.
- **An SSRF vet checks the RESOLVED address, not only the name**: a name blocklist cannot see that a public name an attacker controls points at `127.0.0.1` or `169.254.169.254`, and a wildcard-DNS host needs no zone control at all. Resolution goes through one seam, refuses if ANY answer is private/loopback/link-local/reserved, refuses on failure, and runs on every redirect hop. The residual gap (rebinding between vet and connect) is stated rather than implied away.
- **A routing reference is durable, and losing it never blocks delivery**: the Bot Framework exposes no lookup for a conversation's `serviceUrl`, so `teams/service_urls.py` persists it. Loading is lazy and off-loop (never the boot path), every read failure degrades to the in-memory map, a non-`https` row does not survive a reload, and an identity row whose conversation did not survive is dropped rather than advertising a target with no route to it.
- **Session keys are namespaced**: every key is `channel_type:conversation_id`; only bare legacy Slack `thread_ts` keys are shimmed, via `canonical_key`/`legacy_key`.
- **Runtime identity follows the current turn**: every channel dispatcher passes its trusted transport name as `runtime_source` to `ContextBuilder.build_message`; the shared `drive_turn` pipeline uses `ChannelTurn.channel_type`. A cross-surface resume keeps its original stable session key for conversation continuity, but `[RUNTIME]` names the interface carrying the current message. Follow-up turns refresh the marker because the one-time session context may describe an earlier surface.
- **Channel dashboard visibility is immediate**: after the first successful turn of a Discord, Telegram, Webex, Teams, WeCom, or Weixin-owned session is persisted, the dispatcher triggers the channel-slot reconciler immediately when `dashboard.surface_channel_sessions` is enabled. `DashboardState.register_channel_transport` injects the dashboard state into the bound dispatcher; the lifetime 30-second reconciler remains the recovery path, but the normal first-turn path does not wait for it. Turns that resume an existing `dashboard:` session skip this step because that session already owns a slot.
- **An owner notification is not Slack-only**: `dashboard/server.py::_dm_owner` prefers the owner's Slack DM and falls back to registered channel transports (`_notify_owner_channels`). It used to no-op entirely without Slack, so an expiring unattended grant was invisible on a Teams-only, Discord-only or Telegram-only install — silence about a security grant lapsing is exactly what the notice exists to prevent. Fallback, not addition: an operator with Slack gets one notice, not one per channel. Reachability is the transport's OWN answer, so this can only reach a destination that channel already authorized. **And a channel must be able to NAME the owner: exactly one configured target, or nothing.** The notice carries the operator's own security state, while an allow-list is a list of people permitted to talk to the agent — not a claim that any one of them is the operator. With several configured targets there is no unambiguous owner, and sending to the first reachable one hands one allow-listed human another's auto-approve state; the count is over ALL configured targets, because a three-person allow-list with one learned route is still a guess. Same premise as `/sessions`' owner-only rule. Per-identity authority within an allow-list would let this deliver on a multi-person install; it does not exist yet on any channel.
- **The proactive PRODUCERS are still Slack-shaped, and the parity claim says so**: `api_send_message` (the LLM-facing `send_message` tool) has exactly two legs — the origin dashboard slot and `state.slack_client` — and `file_send` posts to the Slack upload route. Neither consults `state.channel_transports`. A cron result still reaches a non-Slack channel when its origin slot is MIRRORED there (`/link`), which is the normal path; what is missing is the tool's own explicit channel/user addressing, whose allow-list, threading and unfurl semantics are Slack concepts. This is the largest remaining outbound gap and it hurts Discord and Telegram identically — routing it through the transport ladder is a change to that handler's contract, not to a channel.
- **Configured outbound targets are transport-owned**: `MessagingTransport.configured_targets()` returns opaque `ConfiguredChannelTarget` records for the user-configured destinations a dashboard session may link to, including an explicit unavailable reason when a protocol needs prior inbound state or cannot send proactively. `resolve_configured_target()` revalidates the selected opaque id at the side-effect boundary and resolves it to `(conversation_id, thread_id)`; the browser never supplies an unchecked platform conversation id. Discord exposes configured users and threads, and fail-closes thread resolution unless Discord still reports the allow-listed id as an actual thread rather than a normal shared guild channel; Telegram and Webex expose configured DMs; Weixin exposes allow-listed DMs plus authorized peers learned under its open policy; Teams destinations become available after an authorized inbound activity supplies a conversation/service URL; and WeCom destinations (including its allow-all policy placeholder) remain visible but unavailable because its reply token is inbound-bound.
- **Configured-target egress is governed at every yield boundary**: the dashboard mirror-link endpoint enters the shared fail-closed `channels` governance ladder before resolving an opaque target (resolution may itself open a remote DM), rechecks before the initial link message, and rechecks before each historical-context message. A profile that narrows after transport startup therefore stops both target resolution and all subsequent sends.
- **`/link` and `/unlink` are one pair with one location**: `rebind_conversation_location` claims what `release_conversation_location` frees, and both take the channel's single `_origin_mirror_link()` value — the release matches an occupied location by VALUE, so a second spelling of "this conversation" lets it miss the binding the bind wrote. Inside the rebind the **claim goes first**: `batched_save` writes on the way out even when the block raises, so an opt-out withdrawal ordered ahead of a refused claim would persist for a link that never happened and silently turn mirroring back on.
- **Own-channel vs. mirror**: `ChannelLink` models a session's own inbound channel only; the dashboard→Slack mirror binding stays in `SessionMap.get/set_slack_link` (guardrail G3). The generalized channel-neutral outbound mirror (`SessionMap.set_mirror_link`) stores a `ChannelLink` under the `mirror` slot for non-Slack channels, still distinct from the session's own inbound link.
- **Managed-MCP session-key resolution**: every turn-running surface publishes `session_pid_<pid>.txt` (with an HMAC-SHA256 sidecar) through the single shared helper `messaging.identity.publish_turn_identity` (which calls `session_pid_sig.publish_session_pid`), keyed by the session's kiro-cli host PID, so the gateway's ancestor PID-walk resolves the caller's `X-Session-Key`. One writer is called by the dashboard, native Slack, and every shipped channel transport-dispatch surface: Telegram (DM + forum), Discord, Slack, Webex, WeCom, Teams, and Weixin (through the shared `drive_turn`). Any surface that omits it makes every session-keyed managed MCP tool (`learn_add`, cron management, …) fail with HTTP 400 `missing X-Session-Key` from that channel's turns; the identity-topology test guards every dispatcher against regressing.

## Testing conventions

The extraction is gated by a **golden-transcript** harness (`test/test_slack_golden_transcript.py`): a `RecordingSlackClient` captures the ordered sequence of Slack-render operations the native `handle_message` emits for a scripted `ScriptedProvider` event stream, establishing the baseline the `TurnDriver` + `SlackRenderer` rewire must reproduce identically. Layer contracts and the Slack impl have dedicated suites: `test_messaging_transport.py`, `test_messaging_driver.py`, `test_slack_renderer.py`, `test_slack_transport.py`, `test_slack_transport_dispatch.py`, `test_slack_transport_integration.py`. Providers are always mocked (scripted event streams) — never spawn a real kiro-cli process.

## Slack settings API

Three dashboard-only endpoints back the `/settings?tab=channels&channel=slack` panel (legacy `?tab=slack` links redirect there). They are
registered in the dashboard route block (NOT `_register_mcp_routes`, which is
also mounted on the token-less API-only server) so they always sit behind
dashboard token auth.

- `GET /api/slack/config` — masked token previews + presence booleans, owner
  ID, slash command, enterprise-org allowlist, behavior toggles, and live
  status: `connected` (recorded socket connect outcome), `connect_error`
  (short reason, e.g. `invalid_auth`), `read_only` (true unless the request
  is direct-local). Never returns a raw secret.
- `PUT /api/slack/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no `Forwarded`/`X-Forwarded-*`/`X-Real-IP` headers); remote gets 403.
  Validate-first/commit-last. New tokens are verified against Slack before
  storage (`auth.test` for bot, `apps.connections.open` for app tokens);
  rejection returns 400 and writes nothing, network failure saves with
  `verify_warning`. `<field>_clear` must be a strict boolean. Secrets land in
  `config_dir/.env` via atomic 0600 `mkstemp` + `os.replace`, and
  `os.environ` is synced afterward. Response `restart_required` is true for
  actual env changes and boot-read config (`command`,
  `allowed_enterprise_ids`); `reactions_enabled`/`show_thinking` apply live.
  An empty `command` resets the slash command to the default.
- `GET /api/slack/manifest` — public manifest template rendered with
  `?alias=` (default `kirocrew`, never `$USER`) plus Slack's one-click
  create deep link.

`allowed_users` / `open_channels` are intentionally not exposed while the
runtime enforces owner-only access.

## Discord channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/discord/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over a
pure-aiohttp Discord Gateway WebSocket client (`client.py`): identify with
`DIRECT_MESSAGES` for DM-only installs; when `allowed_thread_ids` is non-empty,
also request `GUILD_MESSAGES` and privileged `MESSAGE_CONTENT`. Heartbeat uses
the server interval with jitter,
resume via `resume_gateway_url`/sequence tracking, exponential-backoff
reconnect, and hard stop on non-recoverable close codes (4004/4010-4014).
Outbound is REST v10 (send/edit/typing/reactions/interaction acks) with a
single 429 `retry_after` back-off; malformed (non-JSON) response bodies
degrade to an error result and never propagate into rendering. Attachments ride
the same ladder over multipart (`send_message_with_files` /
`edit_message_with_files`, see "Discord's upload half" above). No public
webhook endpoint is required. `client.ready` (asyncio.Event) is set on
READY/RESUMED and cleared on disconnect; `maybe_start_discord` reports
`connected` only after `wait_ready` succeeds and keeps the dashboard badge
truthful via the `on_state_change` observer (a non-recoverable close flips it
back off with the reason).

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default against
`discord.allowed_user_ids` (snowflakes kept as strings — they exceed 2^53).
DM denials and authorization failures in configured threads are SEL-audited.
Because Discord's global guild/message-content intents deliver every visible
channel message, unrelated guild chatter is discarded silently; an approved
user attempting an unapproved thread remains audit-worthy. Guild turns require
an approved sender and either an exact `discord.allowed_thread_ids` match or an
exact `discord.allowed_channel_ids` match. An allowed channel message is never
handled in the shared channel itself: with `discord.auto_thread` enabled, the
transport creates a public thread from that message and dispatches the turn
there. Existing thread IDs still require a REST channel lookup confirming
Discord type 10/11/12. An approved thread is a shared disclosure
boundary: every member who can view it can read agent/tool output. Enabling any
thread also means Discord delivers message content from every server channel
the bot can see, although Kiro Crew immediately discards traffic outside
approved threads. Bot-authored messages (including our own) are dropped as a
loop guard. `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is on the sandbox agent env denylist.

**Dispatch + rendering.** Turns ride the shared `TurnDriver`.
`transport_dispatch.py` carries the same mid-turn steer/queue/drain/cancel
machinery as the Telegram dispatcher (see "Mid-turn routing, queue receipts &
cancel" above) plus `!compact` under atomic `try_acquire` and the dashboard
mirror `!link`/`!unlink`. The renderer streams via throttled in-place edits
under the 2000-char cap, splitting ordinary text with the shared
`split_markdown_safe` (at 1900 less 100 characters of chip/footer headroom)
and holding local-image markup for secure multipart extraction at the semantic
steer/final seal. It rotates messages at the shared driver's structured steer
boundaries with quote chips, renders trailing `[OPTIONS:]` as button action rows
(`opt:<i>`, label recovered from the component at interaction time), and posts
Approve/Deny buttons for interactive tool approvals. Approval `custom_id`s carry a
per-prompt random nonce (`a:<request_id>:<nonce>:<1|0>`) validated at
resolution: ACP request IDs are reusable across provider/gateway restarts, so a
stale button without the matching nonce fails closed. The decision window
denies by default on timeout and retires the nonce with it.

### Resume-binding expectations (`discord/resume_expectation.py`)

An inbound resume binding lives on the bound session's `session_map.json` row. A recycle, restart prune, or dashboard unlink can destroy that row and the only evidence the channel was attached, so the resolver silently falls back to its DM session; the expectation record makes that loss reportable.

**Store.** `$KIROCREW_HOME/trust/discord_resume_expectations.json` holds channel-id → `{key, title, version, retired}` rows under agent-blocked `trust/`, with an owner-only directory and `restrict_to_owner` file write because modes do not protect files on Windows. `retired` defaults false when loading an older row. Every filesystem step, including `config_dir()`, runs in a worker; an `asyncio.Lock` serializes read-modify-write without spanning Discord I/O.

**Refuse before route.** `DiscordSessionResume.route` returns one `RoutingDecision` containing either the session key or a refusal. Plain turns and session-targeting commands use that decision once; drained turns keep their enqueue-time native decision. `!new`/`!unlink` release every exact-channel binding, `!sessions`/`!help` remain reachable for recovery, and tool approval dispatches no turn while retaining its nonce-keyed visible failure path. Four states run: no owner/no record; no owner/retired record; one owner/no record (bootstrap); one matching owner/active record. Four refuse: active record without owner (lost link, retire after notice), any owner different from the active record or present beside a retired record (announce and adopt after delivery), multiple owners, or a resolution that keeps changing.

**Versioned acknowledgement.** Settlement follows a confirmed send and compare-and-sets the quoted version, so a newer picker/dashboard record wins and failed delivery settles nothing. A delivered detach replaces the active record with a durable retired marker in one write: no owner may route natively, while an owner racing the write still meets retained evidence and is refused before adoption. This avoids a clear-then-restore transaction whose compensating write could fail after evidence was deleted. **Persistence is fail-closed.** Memory publishes only after a durable write; only an absent file means empty, while I/O, UTF-8, JSON, shape, non-integer version, or non-boolean retired errors refuse routing. A pick records before binding. `!unlink`/`!new` serialize map removal, forced off-loop write, and versioned expectation retirement against pickers. Failed forced writes remain owed, keep the active expectation, and visibly fail the command; a later retirement failure costs one self-retiring notice rather than a silent resume.

**Gateway-wide by design.** One unreadable shared file may hide any channel's record, so all Discord routing refuses; a cached-channel exception would silently route the first unknown post-restart channel. Nothing overwrites, quarantines, or discards the file. *Repair:* stop the gateway, copy the file aside, restore or edit it to `channel_id → {key, title, version, retired}` with integer versions and boolean `retired` flags, then restart. Never truncate or delete it; `{}` is valid only when no channel has resume history. **One decision per message.** Route, refusal send, and settlement serialize per channel. Settlement waits for every message queued before the notice; each is refused, and only the last delivered notice settles. **Lifecycle.** This channel-keyed store detects loss but is not routing authority. If a channel-keyed binding authority lands, migrate these rows and delete this state machine.

## Discord settings API

- `GET /api/discord/config` — masked `bot_token_preview` + `bot_token_set`,
  `connected` (true only after the Gateway handshake reached READY this
  session), `connect_error`, `configured` (token AND enabled AND non-empty
  allowlist — the transport fails closed on an empty list), `read_only`
  (true unless the request is direct-local). Never returns a raw secret.
- `PUT /api/discord/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  New tokens must match the three-segment bot-token shape (an accidental
  `Bot ` Authorization prefix or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=` env line is stripped)
  and are verified against Discord `GET /users/@me` before storage; rejection
  returns 400 and writes nothing, network failure saves with
  `verify_warning`. `bot_token_clear` must be a strict boolean.
  `allowed_user_ids`, `allowed_thread_ids`, and `allowed_channel_ids` accept
  numeric snowflake strings only; `auto_thread` is a strict boolean. Secrets
  land in `config_dir/.env` (atomic 0600) with `os.environ`
  synced; non-secrets go to
  `config.json` under `discord`. All fields are boot-read, so
  `restart_required` is true on any actual change.
## Telegram settings API

Two dashboard-only endpoints back the `/settings?tab=channels&channel=telegram` panel (legacy `?tab=telegram` links redirect there). Like the
Slack settings API they are registered in the dashboard route block (NOT
`_register_mcp_routes`) so they always sit behind dashboard token auth.

- `GET /api/telegram/config` — masked bot-token preview + presence boolean,
  `enabled` flag, `allowed_user_ids` (serialized as digit strings for the tag
  editor), `soft_threshold_pct`, forum per-topic config (`allow_forum` bool and
  `allowed_forum_chat_ids` — negative supergroup chat_ids serialized as strings
  for the tag editor), and live status: `connected` (true only
  after startup proved the token with an authenticated `getMe` and the
  long-polling transport started; when Telegram is unreachable at boot the
  channel still starts and reports not-connected until the first successful
  poll — only a *rejected* token aborts startup and closes the client; the
  polling loop updates the flag live, deduped on state change — three
  consecutive `getUpdates` failures flip it false with a reason, the next
  success flips it back), `connect_error` (token-free short reason:
  `TelegramAuthError` message for a rejected token, exception class name
  otherwise), `read_only` (true unless the request is direct-local), and
  `configured` (token AND enabled AND non-empty allowlist — the transport
  fails closed and rejects every message while the allowlist is empty).
  Never returns a raw secret. Token presence considers both the
  `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` credential and the legacy `telegram.bot_token` config
  fallback.
- `PUT /api/telegram/config` — requires a direct-local request (same gate as
  the Slack save); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last. Pasted tokens
  are shape-checked (`<bot_id>:<secret>`) and verified against Telegram
  `getMe` before storage; rejection returns 400 and writes nothing, network
  failure saves with `verify_warning`. `bot_token_clear` must be a strict
  boolean. The secret lands in `config_dir/.env` as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` via
  the same atomic 0600 write, and `os.environ` is synced afterward. Setting
  OR clearing the token also purges the legacy `telegram.bot_token` field
  from `config.json` — the gateway falls back to that field when `.env` is
  empty, so leaving it behind would resurrect a removed credential on the
  next restart. `allowed_user_ids` accepts digit strings or ints and stores
  canonical deduplicated ints; `soft_threshold_pct` is an int in 1–100.
  `allow_forum` must be a strict boolean; `allowed_forum_chat_ids` accepts
  integer-like strings or ints and stores canonical deduplicated ints —
  supergroup chat_ids are NEGATIVE (e.g. `-1001234567890`), so the validator
  accepts a leading minus (NOT the digits-only check used for
  `allowed_user_ids`) and rejects non-integer garbage.
  Every Telegram field is boot-read (consumed in the orchestrator's
  constructor), so `restart_required` is true for any actual change and only
  for actual change.

## Webex channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/webex/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over a
pure-aiohttp Webex client (`client.py`): inbound rides a device-registration
WebSocket — the client registers a device with the Webex Device Management
service (WDM) to obtain a per-device WebSocket URL, connects, authorizes with
the bot token, and receives `conversation.activity` events (the same
mechanism the official `webex-bot` SDK uses; no public webhook endpoint is
required). **Caveat: WDM is an internal Cisco mechanism, not a documented
public API.** Cisco can change frame shapes or endpoints without notice, and
behavior may vary across geo/FedRAMP clusters (the client defaults to the
`wdm-a` host and the `us` Hydra cluster; both the WDM base and the REST base
are constructor parameters for containment). The documented alternative
(webhooks) requires a public inbound URL, which contradicts the local-first
design — this trade-off is deliberate. If WDM drifts, the failure mode is a
truthful "Not active" badge with the reconnect reason (the
`ready`/`on_state_change` machinery), never a silently green channel. A
manual live smoke test with a real bot token is a launch gate for this
channel. Activity events are treated purely as signals: the raw UUID is
Hydra-encoded (`base64("ciscospark://us/MESSAGE/{uuid}")`) and the message is
hydrated via the documented `GET /v1/messages/{id}` REST call in a background
task so the receive loop keeps breathing during long turns. Outbound is REST
(`POST/PUT/DELETE /v1/messages`) with a single 429 `Retry-After` back-off; an
email-shaped conversation id maps onto `toPersonEmail` (opens/reuses the 1:1
space server-side). Outbound markdown is bounded in UTF-8 BYTES, not
characters — Webex's limit is 7439 bytes. Final answers are split losslessly
into 7000-byte chunks (``chunk_utf8``, never splitting a code point) and
single sends are tail-guarded by ``truncate_utf8`` as a last resort, so a
multibyte-heavy reply is never rejected wholesale or silently truncated. The reconnect loop uses exponential backoff with a
minimum-healthy-connection guard so a bad token can never hot-loop.
``client.ready`` (asyncio.Event) is set on connect+authorize and cleared on
disconnect; ``maybe_start_webex`` reports ``connected`` only after
``wait_ready`` succeeds and keeps the dashboard badge truthful via the
``on_state_change`` observer (a disconnect flips it back off with the
reason).

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default against
`webex.allowed_emails` (lowercased comparison); every denial is SEL-audited.
Direct-rooms-only fail-closed: any message from a non-`direct` room is
rejected even from allow-listed users so tool output can never land in a
group space. Self-messages are dropped twice (WS actor email + hydrated
`personId` against the bot identity). `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN` is on the sandbox
agent env denylist.

**Dispatch + rendering.** Turns ride the shared `TurnDriver`
(`transport_dispatch.py` mirrors the WeCom dispatcher: `/new`, `/compact`,
`/help` command intercept, mid-turn messages fold into the running turn via
steer gated on `has_active_turn`, `/compact` under atomic `try_acquire`,
soft/hard context-threshold notices as separate proactive messages). The
renderer is shaped by Webex's 10-edits-per-message cap: no typewriter
streaming (`streaming=False`); a "🤔 Thinking…" placeholder is posted at turn
start, tool-progress status edits are throttled and budgeted to 6 of the 10
edits (an edit failure burns the remaining budget so the final-answer edit
can never race the cap), and the final answer lands as one placeholder edit
with a fresh-message fallback plus chunked follow-ups past the 7000-char cap.
Trailing `[OPTIONS:]` markup is stripped (`max_buttons=0`); interactive tool
approvals run decider-less, so under INTERACTIVE mode the only rung that can
approve a tool here is `ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session`, wired to the
process-global safety-override grant (see [Approval ladder](#approval-ladder)).
With no grant armed the channel stays deny-by-default and the agent can only
talk.

## Webex settings API

- `GET /api/webex/config` — masked `bot_token_preview` + `bot_token_set`,
  `connected` (true only while the device WebSocket is connected + authorized
  this session), `connect_error`, `configured` (token AND enabled AND non-empty
  allowlist — the transport fails closed on an empty list), `read_only`
  (true unless the request is direct-local). Never returns a raw secret.
- `PUT /api/webex/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  New tokens (an accidental `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN=` env line is stripped) are
  verified against Webex `GET /v1/people/me` before storage; rejection
  returns 400 and writes nothing, network failure saves with
  `verify_warning`. `bot_token_clear` must be a strict boolean.
  `allowed_emails` accepts syntactically valid emails only. Secrets land in
  `config_dir/.env` (atomic 0600) with `os.environ` synced; non-secrets go
  to `config.json` under `webex`, and any token set/clear purges the legacy
  `webex.bot_token` config fallback (config.json commits before .env so a
  crash between the two cannot resurrect the plaintext copy). Writes are
  serialized under the repo-wide config lock. All fields are boot-read, so
  `restart_required` is true on any actual change.

## WeCom settings API

- `GET /api/wecom/config` — the shared bot-channel shape with TWO credential
  slots: the panel's primary secret (`bot_token_set`/`bot_token_preview`)
  maps to `WECOM_SECRET`, and a second slot (`bot_id_set`/`bot_id_preview`)
  maps to `WECOM_BOT_ID`. `connected` is LIVE truth kept by the client's
  status callback: `maybe_start_wecom` wires `WeComClient.on_status` into
  dashboard state BEFORE opening the WS (so the first transition cannot be
  missed), and the reconnect loop reports transitions — healthy once a
  connection is up + subscribed; not-healthy with a reason on connect
  failure, an immediate server close (bad credentials), or a server kick.
  This callback is the compensating control for skipping save-time
  credential verification: bad credentials surface on the badge within
  seconds of the gateway starting, not silently never. `connect_error`
  carries that reason, `configured` requires both credentials AND
  enabled AND (a non-empty allow-list OR `allow_all_users`). `allowed_user_ids`
  projects the
  canonical `wecom.allowed_users` `{userid, name}` entries down to userid
  strings for the tag editor. `allow_all_users` is the explicit
  allow-everyone opt-in (default false) — it is a deliberate toggle, never
  inferred from an empty allow-list, and the transport still denies frames
  without a userid under it. Never returns a raw secret.
- `PUT /api/wecom/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  Each credential slot has independent set/clear fields (`bot_token`/
  `bot_token_clear`, `bot_id`/`bot_id_clear`; clear flags must be strict
  booleans, an accidental `WECOM_*=` env-line paste is stripped, inner
  whitespace rejected). There is no pre-store verification: validating WeCom
  credentials needs the AI-bot WebSocket long-connection (no cheap REST
  "whoami"), so `verify_warning` is always empty; the live on_status
  badge (above) surfaces bad credentials within seconds of the channel
  starting. `allowed_user_ids`
  entries must match the WeCom userid shape (1-64 chars of
  letters/digits/`.-_@`, fail closed); the save re-attaches stored display
  names to surviving entries and writes the canonical `{userid, name}` list
  back to `config.json` under `wecom`. `allow_all_users` must be a strict
  boolean. Secrets land in `config_dir/.env`
  (atomic 0600) with `os.environ` synced. Writes are serialized under the
  repo-wide config lock. All fields are boot-read, so `restart_required` is
  true on any actual change.

## Microsoft Teams channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/teams/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over a
pure-`aiohttp` Bot Framework client (`client.py`) plus `PyJWT` for inbound token
validation — no Bot Framework SDK dependency (the optional `kirocrew[teams]`
extra). Teams is the **only** channel whose inbound is a public HTTPS endpoint:
every other channel opens an outbound connection, but "Teams sends a JSON object
to your agent's messaging endpoint, and it allows only one endpoint for
messaging." There is no Socket Mode equivalent, so this is a permanent
architectural divergence, not a gap to close.

**Inbound authenticity is the channel's whole trust boundary.** `on_activity`
extracts the `Authorization: Bearer` token and runs `JwtValidator.verify` off-loop
(`asyncio.to_thread` — a JWKS fetch and an RS256 verify must never sit on the
gateway loop) BEFORE the activity is ACTED ON, returning 401 with a SEL
`denied_invalid_token` row. The route reads and JSON-parses the body first, under
`TEAMS_MAX_ACTIVITY_BYTES`, because that is what bounds it; the guarantee is
"nothing is dispatched pre-auth", not "nothing is read pre-auth". `verify` pins `algorithms=["RS256"]`, sets
`audience` to the bot's App ID, requires `exp`/`iss`/`aud`, allows the
documented five-minute clock skew, and rejects any issuer outside
`{"https://api.botframework.com"}`. `_require_https` pins the scheme of both the
OpenID metadata URL and the resolved `jwks_uri`, closing an arbitrary-file-read
vector (`PyJWKClient` would honour `file://`). `_dispatch_activity` then binds the
outbound target to the token's own `serviceurl` claim: the reply carries an
app-credential bearer token, so a replayed activity pointing `serviceUrl` at an
attacker-controlled host must not receive it.

`_dispatch_activity` also binds the channel POSITIVELY: `activity.channelId` must
equal `msteams`. An Azure Bot resource has Web Chat enabled by default and can
carry Direct Line, and both reach this endpoint with a token that passes every
check above — same issuer, same audience, matching `serviceurl` claim — while
defaulting `conversationType` to `personal`. On Direct Line the CLIENT composes the
`from` object, so `aadObjectId` is not channel-attested and `teams.allowed_emails`
would be matching an identity the sender chose. A negative test ("not some other
channel") would fail open on the next channel Microsoft adds.

Five bounds sit around that check, because this is the one route reachable from
the internet:

- **Route reachability.** `csrf_middleware` applies an Origin check to every
  non-safe method, and the Connector sends neither `Origin` nor `Referer`, so the
  request is refused before the JWT handler runs unless the peer happens to be
  loopback. The route is therefore in the **method-scoped CSRF exemption for
  self-authenticating external webhooks** — sound because CSRF defends against a
  browser attaching cookies cross-origin, and this handler ignores cookies and
  authenticates a JWT a browser cannot forge. Only `POST` is exempt; `PUT`/`DELETE`
  on the same literal path still match dashboard-authed wildcard routes.
- **Failed-auth throttle**, reusing `webhooks.py`'s existing counters, so an
  anonymous flood cannot spend one SEL row per request. Note its SCOPE: the
  throttle is skipped for a proxied request (`is_proxied_request`) because it would
  otherwise key every caller onto the proxy, and two of the three documented
  topologies are proxied. So it is NOT what bounds the JWKS refetch.
- **JWKS refetch damper.** `PyJWKClient.get_signing_key` answers an unknown `kid`
  with an unconditional `refresh=True` fetch and has no rate limit of its own, so
  each bogus-kid POST would buy one outbound HTTPS GET. `JwtValidator._get_signing_key`
  therefore does the kid lookup itself — cached set first, then at most one
  refetch per `_JWKS_REFRESH_MIN_INTERVAL_SECS` — so the damper sits next to the
  fetch it bounds rather than at a route that may not run. A genuinely rotated key
  is still reachable within one interval.
- **Bounded body.** The dashboard route reads the activity under
  `TEAMS_MAX_ACTIVITY_BYTES` and stashes the parsed dict under
  `TEAMS_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_KEY`, so `on_activity` never re-parses an unbounded
  body. The cap lives in the route, keeping `client.py` free of dashboard imports.
- **Replay drop and an in-flight ceiling.** The Connector legitimately redelivers
  when the bot misses its ack window, so a duplicate `activity.id` is dropped
  idempotently (audited `denied_replayed_activity`) rather than refused — checked
  AFTER attestation so an unattested activity cannot consume a dedupe slot. A
  valid-token burst is shed past `_MAX_INFLIGHT_TURNS`, since each turn holds a
  session semaphore and a provider process. Two shapes are EXEMPT, and must be,
  because both are how a saturated gateway gets UNstuck: a card click (Teams
  delivers `Action.Submit` as an ordinary `message` activity, so shedding it drops
  the Approve/Deny press that would free a slot and deadlocks every waiting prompt)
  and `/stop`, whose aliases are DERIVED from `COMMAND_SPEC` rather than copied.
  Neither starts a turn, so neither costs a semaphore.

The handler fast-acks 200 and runs the turn in a background task: the Connector
times out the inbound POST at ~15 seconds, far below an agentic turn.

**Outbound.** `POST/PUT {serviceUrl}/v3/conversations/{id}/activities[/{activityId}]`
with a cached client-credentials token (`login.microsoftonline.com`, scope
`https://api.botframework.com/.default`; the tenant is templated so single-tenant
works). Delivery failure **raises** `TeamsSendError` rather than returning `None`:
every caller treats a return as proof of delivery, so a swallowed error made the
gateway record an answer the user never received. Callers that legitimately
tolerate failure — the typing indicator, a cosmetic in-place edit, a command
acknowledgement — catch it at their own call site. Retries cover Teams' documented
transient set, which is **wider than the usual 429-only rule**: `412`, `429`, `502`
and `504`, honouring `Retry-After` and otherwise backing off exponentially. The
status badge is bidirectional — a delivered activity clears a stale failure, and
`_notify_state` dedupes on the transition so a healthy channel does not republish
per send nor overwrite the first failure reason.

**serviceUrl durability (`service_urls.py`).** The Bot Framework offers no way to
look up where a conversation can be reached: `serviceUrl` arrives on an inbound
activity and the bot must remember it. An in-memory map lost every proactive
destination on restart, so a cron result or dashboard mirror leg had nowhere to
send until the user spoke again. `ServiceUrlStore` persists
`conversation_id -> serviceUrl` (plus the allow-listed identity that owns each
conversation, recorded only AFTER authorization) to
`$KIROCREW_HOME/routing/teams_service_urls.json`. Loading is lazy and off-loop —
never on the gateway boot path — every failure degrades to the in-memory map because
a lost routing hint must not stop delivery, a non-Connector row does not survive a
reload, and the map is bounded by count with least-recently-seen eviction.

It lives in its own `routing/` directory because that directory is a keystone leaf,
so the agent can neither read nor write it: the identity map is what an explicit
`user:<upn>` send target resolves through, and a writable copy delivers one person's
cron result to another. The DIRECTORY is registered rather than the file, so
`atomic_write`'s `mkstemp` temp sibling is covered too — see
[security](security.md#crew-data-home-secrets--governance-trust-root) for why that
distinction is load-bearing. There is no migration from the pre-`routing/` path:
reading the old, agent-writable location would reopen the hole.

Two paths besides an ordinary message keep that map honest, one per direction:

- **Learning without a prompt.** A personal-scope `conversationUpdate`
  (membersAdded) or an `installationUpdate` carries the whole routable tuple —
  conversation id, `serviceUrl`, `aadObjectId` — under exactly the attestation
  above and no prompt, so `TeamsClient.on_route` hands it to
  `TeamsTransport.note_route`, which re-applies the SAME personal-scope and
  allow-list gates `receive` does. A freshly installed app is therefore a proactive
  target before the user first types, without a Connector conversation-creation
  round trip; a join from a channel or a stranger records nothing, so "reachable"
  never comes to mean something other than "authorized".
- **Forgetting a dead route.** Capacity eviction is not enough: once a user blocks
  the bot or removes the app the route is permanently undeliverable, and keeping it
  turns every later cron result and mirror leg into a red badge with nothing able to
  clear it. `TeamsSendError` carries the Connector's `status`, and
  `TeamsTransport.send_message` calls `ServiceUrlStore.forget` on a PERMANENT
  refusal only (`403`/`404` — not `401`, our credential, and not `429`/`5xx`, which
  are transient), dropping the identity row with the conversation and persisting it
  so the next process does not re-advertise it.

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default against
`teams.allowed_emails` (matching the UPN/email when Teams supplies one, else the
AAD object id, since activities carry that more reliably); an empty allow-list
authorizes nobody. **Personal-scope only, fail closed:** any non-`personal`
conversation type is denied and audited BEFORE authorization, because a reply in a
channel or group chat would expose tool output to members who are not on the
allow-list. `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` / `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD` /
`MICROSOFT_APP_TENANT_ID` are on the sandbox agent env denylist, and
`pod/runtime.py` forces `teams.enabled = false` in a sanitized seed and scrubs the
`MICROSOFT_APP_` prefix — a pod that inherited a real config would otherwise drive
the operator's production bot and answer real people.

**Dispatch + rendering.** Turns ride the shared `TurnDriver` through
`messaging/dispatch.py::drive_turn`. The command vocabulary lives in ONE table,
`teams/commands.py::COMMAND_SPEC`, which drives both the parser and the `/help`
card so the two cannot drift: `/new`, `/compact`, `/stop` (alias `/cancel`),
`/yolo`, `/link`, `/unlink`, `/sessions`, `/dashboard`, `/help`, plus the `/queue` and `/steer` per-message
directives. A bare directive answers with usage rather than handing the
literal `/queue` to the model, which would reply to it as chat text.
`/dashboard [<N>h|<N>m]` MINTS a presigned dashboard login token for the asking
identity (default and cap from `commands.parse_dashboard_ttl`) and is SEL-audited,
so every address on `teams.allowed_emails` can issue itself a dashboard session —
the same premise that scopes `/yolo` to one conversation.

**`/sessions` continues a dashboard chat here** (`teams/session_resume.py`), on the
same shared core Discord uses. What Teams supplies is the widget — an Adaptive Card
whose `Action.Submit` returns as an ordinary message activity, so it needs no `invoke`
handler — plus its own display redaction and command spellings. Three properties are
Teams-specific and load-bearing:

- **Owner-only, and STRICTER than Discord's rule.** Discord requires exactly one
  configured user id. Teams' allow-list routinely holds several people, and a dashboard
  session is the operator's whole working transcript, so listing is refused unless
  `teams.allowed_emails` holds exactly one identity. With more than one it refuses
  everybody rather than picking the first entry — the same premise that scopes nothing
  else on that list to one person.
- **The submit carries an INDEX, never a session key.** A key in the payload would be an
  instruction to bind whatever the sender named; an index is resolved against the list
  this process actually offered, so a forged or replayed press can only ever miss. The
  registry additionally scopes on the owner and on the posting the press came from.
- **Routing runs BEFORE the command intercept.** `/compact` and `/stop` act on the
  RESOLVED session, so after a binding was destroyed they would compact or cancel the
  native Teams session while the user believes they drive the resumed one. Deciding once,
  upstream, makes that structural instead of something each handler must remember; the
  decision is then threaded into the turn and never re-resolved. `/sessions`, `/new`,
  `/unlink` and `/help` stay reachable while routing refuses, because a user whose link
  broke needs the way back in. A resumed turn does NOT rotate its generation — rotation
  belongs to this conversation, and applying it would move the user off the transcript
  they just attached to. `/new` and `/unlink` release the binding, and a release that
  cannot be made durable changes nothing and says so.
- **A refusal that did not land settles nothing.** Settlement clears (or adopts) the
  durable record the refusal was owed for, so applying it after an undelivered notice
  routes the user's NEXT message into a transcript they were never told about. Both
  channels gate on delivery: Discord on `send_message`'s own boolean, Teams on `_reply`'s
  (which is why that helper returns one at all — a cosmetic command ack is still logged
  and swallowed, but a notice that gates durable state is not cosmetic). An unsettled
  record owes the same refusal again, which is the direction that fails safe.
- **A card click resolves against BOTH keys of its conversation.** The turn registers
  its decider and its renderer under the key it ran with, which for a resumed
  conversation is the bound `dashboard:` one — so `_handle_card_action` keyed only off
  the native `teams:{email}` session would find neither, tell the user the prompt is
  stale, and let the tool deny by default at the prompt timeout. It tries
  `_click_session_keys` (resumed, then native) in order. Both, not just the resolved
  one, because a card click is a relief activity that bypasses the busy check: a
  `/sessions` pick can bind the conversation while an earlier turn is still in flight,
  and that turn's cards stay registered under the key it started with. Both keys belong
  to the same conversation and identity, so this widens nothing — at most one of them
  holds a given `(request_id, nonce)` pair, and the per-prompt nonce still decides.

**Which identity the allow-list authorizes.** A Teams activity may carry a UPN, an
AAD object id, or both, and `teams.allowed_emails` accepts either form. So
`TeamsTransport._resolve_identity` picks the form the list actually AUTHORIZES rather
than a fixed preference order: a plain email-first rule denies a user whose OBJECT ID
is allow-listed whenever Teams also sends an email — the ordinary shape for a guest
account and for any tenant that lists object ids — with the entry sitting right there
in the list. When both forms match, the email wins, so an install listing both keeps
the human-readable session key it already had. An unauthorized sender falls back to
email-then-object-id so the deny audit names them recognisably.

The decision is then CARRIED, on `TeamsInbound.resolved_identity`, and read in exactly
ONE place per module: `TeamsTransport._resolve_identity` makes it,
`TeamsDispatcher._identity` reads it. Every re-derivation is a chance to disagree, and
each one that existed did: the transport admitted a user on their object id while the
dispatcher keyed the session on their UPN (a session nobody authorized, which owner-only
`/sessions` then refuses), and `handle_message` keyed a turn on the UPN while
`_handle_card_action` keyed the click on the object id (so the approval card resolved
against a session nothing was awaiting, expired, and the tool denied by default — and
`/new` rotated a generation the turn was not using). `_identity` falls back to
email-then-object-id for an inbound built outside `receive` (tests, and the route-only
activities that never reach a turn), which is the same answer whenever only one form is
present.

**The credential check verifies outside the config lock and CONFIRMS inside it.** The
save-time Azure token exchange is a network round trip, and `_get_config_lock()`
serializes every config writer in the process — holding it across that call would stall
unrelated saves, and a hung endpoint would wedge them until the timeout. So the check runs
first, records the exact `(app_id, password, tenant)` Azure accepted, and the commit path
re-derives that triple under the lock and refuses (`config_changed`) if it moved. Without
the confirmation, two concurrent saves — one changing the app id, one the secret — each
verify a triple containing the other's old value, both pass, and the serialized commits
merge into a stored triple neither one checked: a green "Saved." and a channel that is
dead at the next restart. Optimistic concurrency, not a longer lock.

**A quote-reply is unwrapped before anything reads the text.** Right-click → Reply
in a 1:1 chat — the only scope this channel serves — makes Teams PREPEND the quoted
message to `activity.text`, while the user's own words sit in the `text/html` body
attachment after a `<blockquote itemtype="http://schema.skype.com/Reply">`.
`attachments.quoted_reply_text` recovers them, and the client prefers that over
`activity.text`. Without it a quote-replied `/stop` no longer starts with `/`, so it
reaches the model as prose and the turn keeps running, and a quote-replied question
arrives with the previous message jammed onto the front. The helper returns `""` for
any shape it does not recognise, so an unfamiliar client degrades to `activity.text`
rather than losing the message, and the body attachment is still never ingested as a
FILE (that would duplicate the prompt).

**Tool approval is an Adaptive Card** (`teams/cards.py`, `teams/approvals.py`).
Teams renders no Block Kit and no message components, but an `Action.Submit` on a
card returns as an ORDINARY `message` activity whose `value` carries the button's
payload — which is why `Action.Submit` is used and `Action.Execute` is not: a
universal action arrives as an `invoke` needing a synchronous
`{statusCode, type, value}` body, incompatible with the fast-ack-then-background
shape the Connector's inbound timeout forces. The card offers Approve / Trust
session / Deny, mirroring Slack's three, and `[OPTIONS:]` choices ride the same
mechanism as chips through the shared `apply_options_cap` (`max_buttons=5` — BELOW
Slack's 10, because Adaptive Card actions render as full-width buttons on mobile —
and overflow degrades to a numbered text list rather than vanishing).

**A chip is turn content, never a command.** The chip re-dispatch passes
`interpret_commands=False`, exactly as the queue drain does, and that is a security
boundary rather than a nicety: a label comes from the MODEL's own `[OPTIONS:]`
trailer and display redaction does not strip a leading `/`, so with interpretation
on a model that emitted `[OPTIONS: /dashboard | cancel]` would render a chip whose
single tap mints a dashboard login credential.

Two properties make a click safe, and both are the reason this is not a bare dict
of futures:

- **A stale card cannot answer a live prompt.** ACP request ids restart at 1 in
  every provider process, so a card still sitting in a chat from a previous run
  can name an id that is live again for a DIFFERENT tool. Every prompt mints a
  nonce, compared on resolve; the registry key is namespaced by session because
  two sessions can await id `1` at once. A timeout, an unknown id, a mismatched
  nonce and an already-answered prompt all resolve to "not approved".
- **The payload carries no authority.** A submit is client input, so it is only
  ever a LOOKUP key into state this process holds. An option chip's label is read
  from what that turn actually offered, never from the payload, so a forged label
  cannot be injected as if the user had typed it.

An answered prompt's card is REPLACED with its outcome (`resolved_card`, no
actions), so a chat never accumulates live buttons that resolve to nothing; a
click that resolves nothing tells the user, because a button that silently does
nothing is indistinguishable from a broken bot. Three cases reach that same
replacement, because "answered" is not the only way a prompt stops being live:

- **Expiry.** The decider calls `on_expired` (wired to the renderer, which is the
  only thing that knows where the card is) when the click window closes, so the
  buttons do not keep looking live forever.
- **A card that never landed.** The nonce is armed BEFORE the post so a fast click
  is not refused as stale, which means a failed post leaves an armed prompt with no
  control. `TeamsApprovalDecider.abandon` denies it AT ONCE and the renderer says
  so, instead of parking the turn for the full window behind a card nobody received.
  A delivered card whose activity id Teams merely WITHHELD is not this case; both
  read as an empty string, and `_card_posted` is what separates them.
- **A chip pick.** `settle_options` replaces the chips card with the choice before
  the turn runs, so no other chip still looks live and the transcript records which
  one was picked. If the chips card could not be posted at all the choices degrade
  to a numbered text list — the trailer was already cut from the body, so silence
  would lose them — and the nonce is dropped so no later press resolves against a
  card that does not exist.

**The typing indicator is kept alive.** A Teams typing activity expires after a few
seconds, so one at turn start leaves a minutes-long turn showing dots briefly and
then a silent chat, which a user cannot distinguish from a dead bot. The renderer
refreshes it every `_TYPING_REFRESH_S` until the turn finalizes (~1% of Teams'
7 requests/second per-thread budget); the progress bubble only covers a turn that
CALLS a tool, so a long pure generation or a `/compact` has nothing else to show.
Both `on_done` and `close` cancel the loop, because an orphaned refresh would post
into a finished conversation for the process lifetime.

`ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session` is the second rung, letting a user stop being
asked per tool. Teams passes `() -> safety_override().is_active()` — the ONE
process-wide grant, and nothing else. The field is an **additive** widening of the
shared pipeline (`None` default, and `TurnDriver` already accepted the parameter),
so a channel that does not set it keeps deny-by-default byte for byte.

Both ways a Teams user can arm that grant go through the SAME shared helper:
`/yolo` calls `messaging.commands.run_yolo_command`, and the card's middle button
calls it with `"on"`. So the duration, the expiry, the renewal grammar and the SEL
row are identical whichever way the user asked, and neither can disagree with the
dashboard toggle. Teams deliberately keeps **no grant store of its own** — a
channel-local trusted set would be a second grant with its own lifetime and its own
answer to "is YOLO on?", and it would have had to reimplement expiry, renewal and
auditing that the shared helper already owns. `approvals.TeamsApprovalDecider` only
RECORDS that the button was pressed (`trusted`), because arming is async and audited
while the click path is sync; the dispatcher arms it, before settling the card, so
the label cannot claim a grant that failed to arm. The grant does not weaken the
PreToolUse gate: the sensitive-path keystone, the governance ceiling and the
deny-list all run ahead of the auto-approve ladder, so a hard DENY still wins.

The renderer lazily opens ONE progress
message on the first tool call and edits it in place (throttled — Teams' limit is
7 requests/second per thread), and at `on_done` reuses that message for the first
chunk of the answer so no "Working…" bubble is stranded above the reply. Splitting
goes through the shared fence-safe `split_markdown_safe` off-loop, not blind
fixed-width slicing, so a long reply cannot be cut through the middle of a code
fence. The delivered text is re-scanned in its **display** form
(`messaging/display_safety.py::redact_for_display`) at that single chokepoint,
because stripping the trailer and letting Teams render markdown can reassemble a
credential the driver's scan saw as broken. Messages carry
`textFormat: "markdown"`; note Teams renders only a markdown SUBSET in a plain
message (bold, italic, preformatted, blockquote, links — **not** headings, lists,
tables or images), which is the largest remaining content-fidelity gap versus
Slack mrkdwn.

`on_thinking` is a no-op, matching every non-Slack channel.

### Teams' file halves (`teams/attachments.py`)

Both capability flags are `True`, and both are deliberately narrower than the
platform. `teams/attachments.py` owns only what is Teams-shaped; classification,
limits, signature validation, temp-file ownership, reference scanning, the
security floor and the byte budgets all stay in `messaging/attachments.py` and
`messaging/outbound_files.py`.

**Outbound: inline images only, and that is a scope decision, not a gap.** An
`Attachment` whose `contentUrl` is a `data:image/png;base64,…` URI renders with no
hosting and no round trip, which covers the case this exists for — an
agent-produced chart. A NON-image file would need the `FileConsentCard` flow:
a consent card (`application/vnd.microsoft.teams.card.file.consent`), a user
accept, a `fileConsent/invoke` activity carrying `uploadInfo.uploadUrl`, a `PUT`
of the bytes with `Content-Range`, then a `…card.file.info` confirmation — plus
`supportsFiles: true` in the app manifest. Be precise about the blocker: that
`invoke` needs no synchronous body of its own (unlike `Action.Execute`, which does —
see the card section), so the fast-ack ingress is not what rules it out. What rules
it out is SCOPE: five new wire shapes, a per-upload state machine keyed on a consent
the user may never give, and a chunked `PUT` — for a case an inline raster already
covers. A non-inlinable reference is refused visibly instead, and this paragraph is
the record of the decision rather than of an impossibility.

- **The seal is `on_done`, and it is the only one.** Teams does not stream, so
  there are no live frames that could flash markup before the seal replaces it and
  no length rotation that could bisect a reference — the two hazards Discord's
  `hide_local_refs` and upload-eligibility flag exist to handle. Extraction runs
  once per turn through `extract_local_refs_off_loop`, gated behind a `"!["`
  substring pre-check so an ordinary answer never touches the filesystem.
- **Named ceilings fed in as budgets.** `TEAMS_MAX_INLINE_IMAGE_BYTES` (1 MiB,
  Teams' documented picture limit), `TEAMS_MAX_INLINE_IMAGES` (4 — each image is
  its own activity against a 7-requests/second-per-thread limit) and
  `TEAMS_MAX_INLINE_TOTAL_BYTES` become one `ExtractLimits`, so an oversize image
  is refused *by the read* and keeps its markdown. Base64 inflation costs nothing
  here: Teams' ~100 KB activity-payload budget explicitly EXCLUDES a base64 image,
  so the picture limit is the only bound that binds.
- **One activity per image, sent after the text.** Teams SPLITS an activity
  carrying both text and an attachment and withholds its id, and its own guidance
  is to send separate activities rather than depend on that split.
- **The format allow-list is `{image/png, image/jpeg}`** — narrower than the
  neutral sniffer. Teams documents PNG/JPEG/GIF but states animated GIF does not
  render, and whether a GIF is animated is not decidable from leading bytes, so
  accepting the format would mean sometimes sending the one shape Teams refuses.
  WebP and BMP are not in its documented set. Pixel dimensions (Teams caps a
  picture at 1024×1024) are deliberately NOT pre-checked: it would mean decoding a
  header per format and would refuse an ordinary 1200-pixel-wide chart.
- **Every refusal is returned and audited, and no picture disappears in silence.**
  A neutral-module refusal (sensitive path, symlink, not-a-raster, over the per-file
  ceiling) keeps its original markdown, so the path stays visible. Two Teams-owned
  refusals cannot: `teams_inline_unsupported` (a real raster Teams will not inline)
  and `teams_inline_undelivered` (an activity that failed) are only knowable AFTER
  the read, by which point extraction has cut the markup — so those name the
  **resolved path** in their refusal line instead, keeping the same property by a
  different route. This is the one documented deviation from the neutral contract's
  "keeps its original markup". That line is therefore the ONLY surviving trace of the
  picture, so it is never budget-dropped: `_append_rejections` does not check
  `max_message_chars`, because every caller chunks and an over-cap body costs one
  extra message rather than a lost line. The undelivered-image follow-up is chunked
  for the same reason — a refusal quotes an LLM-authored path, so it has no bound of
  its own. Refusal lines are appended BEFORE display redaction, so a destination
  quoted in one is scanned like the rest of the answer.
- **The attachment NAME is a display sink too, and both its sources are untrusted.**
  `inline_image_name` prefers the (already redacted) alt text and falls back to the
  path's basename — which the model also wrote. `_SAFE_NAME_RE` preserves
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, every character an `AKIA…` key id or a `ghp_…` token needs, and
  extraction has already cut the path out of the body, so for an empty caption this
  name is the only remaining sink. Both the SOURCE and the finished name are scanned
  and any hit collapses the whole name to `image.<ext>`; scanning the source too is
  not belt-and-braces, because the 64-char cut can slice a token down to a prefix the
  scanner no longer matches.
- **The approved root, and the one gate.** Extraction needs the provider's real
  `cwd`. `authorize_upload_root(root)` is the public setter a caller holding the
  live provider uses (same contract as Discord's renderer); absent that, the
  renderer resolves the SAME value lazily and off-loop from the session map's
  persisted per-session `cwd`, which is recorded from `provider.cwd` at session
  creation. It fails closed on every uncertain case — no row, a relative path, an
  unreadable map — because an unknown root means there is no boundary to check a
  reference against. Teams needs no analogue of Discord's restricted-session
  ceiling (a personal chat is already a 1:1 boundary gated by `allowed_emails`),
  but a `dashboard:`-namespaced key is refused anyway: a dashboard slot can be
  incognito and the renderer cannot resolve that signal. Audits carry counts and
  closed reason codes only, never the destination or a file name.

**Inbound needs `supportsFiles: true` in the MANIFEST.** Microsoft states plainly
that without it the file features do not work, and "receive files in personal chat"
is one of them — so an operator who skips it gets a bot that never sees a PDF, Word
document or text file, with no error and no refusal line, while pasted inline images
keep working (they arrive as an image `contentUrl`, not a
`file.download.info` attachment). The shipped guide lists it as a REQUIRED step for
that reason. Microsoft also does not support Teams file send/receive in GCC High,
DoD or 21Vianet.

**Ingest runs in the DISPATCHER, not the transport**, and the placement is
load-bearing rather than tidiness. It sits after the governance gate, after the
command intercept and after the busy check, so: nothing is fetched for a message
that ends up QUEUED (a mid-turn arrival may wait minutes), and the temp files are
unlinked by the same frame that awaits the turn reading them. Downloading at arrival
and unlinking in that frame left the drained turn a prompt naming a file that no
longer existed — `acp/prompt_blocks.py` skips a path that is not a file, so the model
received a bare `/tmp` path and answered about nothing, silently. Two rules follow
from the same place: an attachment-bearing message is never STEERED (a steer carries
text only, so the files would be dropped while the user is told they were folded in)
and never read as a COMMAND (Teams puts the caption in `text`, so "/stop here is the
log" would cancel the turn AND discard the file). The queue entry carries the RAW
descriptors and the drained turn re-ingests them, bounded by
`IngestLimits().max_attachments` so a burst is answered across turns instead of
having its surplus refused. Discord and Telegram draw every one of these lines in
the same place.

**Inbound: two kinds with OPPOSITE auth.** `TeamsInbound.attachments` carries
`activity.attachments` raw, and nothing is fetched until the personal-scope gate,
the identity resolution and the allow-list check have all passed in
`transport.receive` — the dispatcher, one layer in, is only reached after them, so an
unauthorized sender or a group conversation can never make the gateway fetch
anything. A file-only activity (attachments, no text) survives the empty-activity
guard, or the whole message would be discarded. Temp paths are owned by the frame
that awaits the turn and unlinked in a worker once it returns.

- **A personal-chat upload** arrives as
  `application/vnd.microsoft.teams.file.download.info`, whose `content.downloadUrl`
  Microsoft documents as a URL the reader "can issue an `HTTP GET` directly from"
  (the underlying Graph `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` says "Authentication isn't
  required with this URL" and is short-lived). It is fetched with **no credential,
  ever** — the Connector token is credential-equivalent and that host is not
  guaranteed to be one Microsoft operates.
- **An inline image** arrives with a `contentUrl`, and here Microsoft contradicts
  itself: the current page says the SDK handles authentication and its samples send
  no header, while the previous revision of the same page and the shipped sample
  attach the bot's Connector token. The host is not documented at all. So the
  decision fails closed on the host: the token is offered only to a recognized Bot
  Framework host (`_TOKEN_HOSTS_EXACT` / `_TOKEN_HOST_SUFFIXES`, dot-anchored so a
  lookalike cannot satisfy the match), and the anonymous fetch is tried as well, in
  that order. Both orders are documented as correct somewhere; trying both costs
  one extra request on a 401.
- **Bounds, in two halves.** `_vet_download_url` is the NAME check: https, no
  non-443 port, no IP literal, and not the loopback/link-local name space — with the
  FQDN root dot stripped first, because `localhost.` is the same host to every
  resolver and a blocklist comparing the raw name refuses one spelling while admitting
  the other. `_vet_resolved_address` is the second half, and it is the one a name
  blocklist cannot do: any public name an attacker controls can point at `127.0.0.1`
  or `169.254.169.254`, and a nip.io-style wildcard needs no control of a zone at all.
  It resolves through the single `resolve_addresses` seam (off-loop; also the one
  place a test can supply a record) and refuses if ANY answer is private, loopback,
  link-local, reserved, multicast or unspecified — stricter than "the one we would
  connect to", because the ordering aiohttp picks is not ours to predict. Resolution
  failure refuses too. It matters that this is a READ primitive, not a blind one: the
  body is written to a temp file and a text/document body is injected into the prompt,
  so the model would summarize an internal endpoint back into the chat.

  **The socket dials the address that was vetted.** Checking a NAME cannot close DNS
  rebinding: aiohttp resolves the URL host itself, so a pre-fetch vet and the connect are
  two lookups, and the second — microseconds before the socket opens — can answer
  `169.254.169.254`. So the vet RETURNS what it approved and the fetch pins it, and
  attachment fetches use their own `ClientSession` whose `TCPConnector` resolves through
  `_VettedResolver`: it serves pinned answers and refuses to resolve anything else, so
  there is no second lookup to poison and a code path reaching that session without
  vetting cannot fetch at all. aiohttp still sees the original URL, so TLS SNI and the
  `Host` header carry the real hostname — connecting by IP instead would break
  certificate validation. The pin map is bounded (`_PINNED_HOSTS_MAX`); an evicted entry
  costs a fresh lookup, never a weaker check, because the next fetch vets before it pins.
  The Connector session deliberately does NOT share this resolver: its hosts are gated by
  `connector_host_allowed`, a different and stricter rule, and routing them through a pin
  map would make an outbound activity depend on a download's state.

  Both halves run on EVERY redirect hop — at most three, followed MANUALLY so the
  credential decision is retaken for the host that actually serves the bytes — and
  `TEAMS_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` is enforced on bytes actually READ so a lying
  `Content-Length` cannot smuggle an unbounded body. Every write goes through a
  worker thread.
- **What is not a file.** Teams echoes rich text as a `text/html` attachment on
  ordinary messages, and a card can ride an activity; both are skipped without a
  note, because a per-message line would be pure noise. Any other unrecognized
  content type is reported by TYPE — not by file name — and never fetched.

`test/test_teams_attachments.py` pins the policy half (envelope mapping, the auth
flag per kind, the budgets, name sanitization, the refusal codes);
`test/test_teams_files.py` pins the wire half (the credential decision, URL
vetting, the read ceiling, the seal, and the inbound gate ordering).

## iMessage channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/imessage/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over the
external `imsg` CLI (MIT, macOS 14+) in its long-lived `rpc` mode: the gateway
spawns it as a child and speaks newline-framed JSON-RPC 2.0 over the child's
stdin/stdout, the same shape as a language server. No daemon, no port, no
webhook, and therefore **no new inbound network surface**; the child exits
cleanly when stdin closes, so the existing subprocess lifecycle applies
unchanged. `rpc.py` owns only the framing (request correlation, notification
routing, oversized/unparseable-line tolerance, a stdout limit far above
asyncio's 64 KiB default so one large line cannot kill the reader);
`client.py` owns iMessage semantics.

**Why an external bridge rather than Python.** iMessage has no server-side API,
so both halves a channel needs are macOS-native problems: following the Messages
SQLite database and its WAL through filesystem events (with a poll backstop,
because macOS drops events and rotates sidecar files) and dispatching a send
through Messages.app. A reimplementation would be a second, worse copy of a
moving target, and would put database-corruption and TCC-permission handling
inside the gateway process. The dependency is one binary the operator installs
with a package manager, and its absence is detectable and reportable at startup.

**Local-only is the design constraint, not a preference.** Hosted relays exist
that will hand you an iMessage-capable number and let any Linux host drive it
over an API. That is explicitly rejected: it puts a third party in the message
path of the one channel whose entire value is that the transport is the user's
own device and their own account.

**Inbound.** `watch.subscribe` on the all-chat stream with a `since_rowid`
cursor persisted to `$KIROCREW_HOME/imessage_cursor.json`, so a gateway restart
replays what it missed instead of losing it. The cursor advances on every
observed row, including ones the channel drops — a cursor that tracked only
delivered messages would replay every skipped row on the next start. Two
behaviours of the subscription are handled explicitly rather than discovered in
production:

- The subscription is **bounded** (`buffer_limit`, default 256). When it fills
  it ENDS, with one terminal `watch.overflow` notification carrying
  `resume_after_rowid`; the client resubscribes at that cursor with capped
  exponential backoff. Ignoring this makes the channel go permanently silent
  under a burst rather than lose one message.
- That cursor is at or before the first dropped message, so **duplicate replay
  is possible by design**. A bounded dedupe window keyed on message GUID
  (`DEDUPE_WINDOW = 1024`, deliberately larger than the buffer) is therefore
  required, not optional.

**Outbound.** `send` with a `to` handle. The result's `id`/`guid` are
best-effort in the bridge's own contract, so their absence is treated as success
with no id, never as failure.

**Typing and read receipts.** `typing` and `read` are documented exceptions to
the bridge's injected-helper requirement (typing keeps a direct-IMCore fallback,
read keeps bridge activation), so they work on a default install with
`bridge.ready = false`. Availability is probed from the `initialize`/`status`
readiness snapshot's `methods` field — the structurally usable surface at that
instant — and each degrades silently and permanently on first rejection, because
their parameter lists are not part of the bridge's documented surface. This
matters because iMessage cannot edit a sent message, so the typing indicator is
the only progress signal the channel has.

**Capabilities.** `streaming=False` and `edit=False` (no message mutation
exists), `reactions=False`, `files_inbound=False`, `files_outbound=False`,
`threads=False`, `max_buttons=0` (no tappable choices — a trailing `[OPTIONS:]`
trailer is stripped like on the other button-less channels),
`supports_proactive_send=True` (a Mac may message a handle at any time; there is
no 24-hour window), `supports_session_resume=False` (inbound routes off the
handle, not a mirrored session binding). `max_message_chars=4000` is declared
conservatively rather than measured: iMessage publishes no maximum, and this
field is a claim other code trusts, so under-declaring costs an extra message
while over-declaring risks a send the platform silently refuses.

**Access control.** Handle allowlist, deny-by-default — an empty allowlist
authorizes nobody, which is the correct posture for a channel with no org
boundary in front of it. Handles are normalized before comparison (email folds
to lowercase, phone loses formatting) so `+61 400 000 000` and `+61400000000`
are one handle. **Group chats fail closed** with a
`denied_group_chat` audit: a reply there would deliver tool output to members who
are not on the allowlist, the same reasoning that makes Telegram and Webex
direct-only. Unauthorized inbound is dropped with no reply, so an unknown sender
learns nothing about what they reached.

**Own-message suppression is TWO signals, and the gate order is load-bearing.**
Neither part is a defensive extra: a self-chat loop that answered its own replies
without bound shipped once (issue #5246), and each rule below is what closes it.

1. `is_from_me` drops the rows the bridge already attributes to the agent, without
   an audit event — the all-chat watch sees its own replies, and auditing them
   would log one entry per outbound message.
2. That flag is not sufficient on its own. In a **self-chat** the allow-listed
   handle IS the identity the agent sends as, and the bridge writes the
   attribution asynchronously (`watch.subscribe` defaults to a 500ms debounce
   expressly so an `is_from_me` correction can land), so an echo can arrive
   looking exactly like user input. The client therefore keeps a short-lived
   **ledger of what it sent** — one record per sent message, holding both the
   body it went out with and the guid the bridge reported, consumed whole on a
   match — and the transport consults it as the LAST gate before dispatch.

The ordering constraints are the part a refactor must preserve:

* The ledger check runs **after** the `is_from_me` drop, so a copy the platform
  already attributes to the agent cannot consume the record that the
  *unattributed* echo needs.
* It runs **after** the group and allowlist gates, because consuming is a side
  effect: a row that will be dropped anyway must not spend the record on its way
  out.
* A record's TTL starts when the send **resolves**, not when it is issued, and an
  unresolved record is never pruned or evicted — the echo of a slow send arrives
  before its result does.

Reordering any of those reintroduces the loop. The accepted cost is a bounded
one: an allow-listed sender who repeats the agent's exact text within the TTL has
that message suppressed once, in any chat rather than only a self-chat.

**Rendering.** Only the final answer is delivered; reasoning and tool activity
stay in the gateway. There is no placeholder message, because there is no edit
to rewrite it with — every other channel's "🤔 Thinking…" would be stranded
above the reply permanently. Markdown is flattened (`plaintext.py`) before
sending, with **fenced code-block contents passed through verbatim**: code is
what a user copies out of a message, and unwrapping or re-indenting it corrupts
it silently. Splitting runs last, on already-flat text, preferring a paragraph
break, then a line break, then a space, then a hard cut that still respects
grapheme clusters (a cut inside a flag, a skin-toned emoji, or a combining
accent renders as mojibake on both sides). CJK text, having no spaces, always
reaches the hard-cut path.

**Topology: v1 requires the gateway to run ON the Messages host,** and refuses
to start elsewhere. A gateway running remotely could point `cli_path` at a
transparent stdio wrapper and would appear to work — it can read chats and
process inbound — while outbound sends fail with an AppleEvents authorization
error (`-1743`), because the Automation grant is recorded against the
remote-shell server process, which macOS exposes no grantable toggle for.
Shipping that topology would mean shipping a send path that cannot be made to
work, so the channel refuses and reports why.

**Host requirements.** macOS 14+ with Messages signed in; Full Disk Access for
the process context that reads the Messages database; Automation permission for
Messages.app for sends. Both grants are per process context, so a headless
launch-agent gateway needs its own one-time interactive grant.

**Deliberately out of scope for v1.** Group chats, attachments in either
direction, SMS-only operation, and every message mutation (tapbacks, edit,
unsend, effects, polls, group management). Those last ones require injecting a
helper into Messages.app, which requires System Integrity Protection to be
disabled system-wide. **v1 must not require SIP changes** — asking a user to
disable SIP to talk to their own agent is not an acceptable default.

**Pod isolation.** `pod/runtime.py` forces `imessage.enabled = false` in a
sanitized seed. iMessage is the one channel with no credential to scrub, so a
pod that inherited `enabled: true` from a real config would drive the operator's
actual Messages.app and reply to real people.

## iMessage settings API

- `GET /api/imessage/config` — `connected` (true only while the bridge's watch
  is live this session, kept truthful by `IMessageClient.on_state_change`),
  `connect_error`, `configured` (enabled AND a non-empty allowlist — the
  transport fails closed on an empty list), `supported` (false off macOS, so the
  UI can explain the requirement instead of leaving the operator to infer it
  from a channel that never connects), `read_only` (true unless the request is
  direct-local), plus `enabled`, `cli_path`, `db_path`, `allowed_handles`,
  `service` and `session_folder`. **There is no credential in this payload** —
  no mask, no presence boolean, nothing to rotate.
- `PUT /api/imessage/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  `allowed_handles` accepts an Apple Account email or a phone-shaped handle
  (linear string checks, no regex, so an operator-supplied list cannot trigger
  polynomial backtracking). `service` must be one of `imessage` / `sms` /
  `auto`, sharing one `IMESSAGE_SERVICES` constant with the loader's clamp so
  the form's choices and the config normalization cannot drift. `cli_path` and
  `db_path` reject line breaks and NULs: they become `argv` of a spawned child
  (via `create_subprocess_exec`, never a shell), where a newline would corrupt
  the argument rather than be quoted. Writes go to `config.json` under
  `imessage`, serialized under the repo-wide config lock. Every field except
  `session_folder` is boot-read, so `restart_required` is true on any other
  change.
